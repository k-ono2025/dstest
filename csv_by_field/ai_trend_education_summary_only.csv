MiBoard: Multiplayer Interactive Board Game,"Serious games have recently emerged as an avenue for curriculum delivery.
Serious games incorporate motivation and entertainment while providing pointed
curriculum for the user. This paper presents a serious game, called MiBoard,
currently being developed from the iSTART Intelligent Tutoring System. MiBoard
incorporates a multiplayer interaction that iSTART was previously unable to
provide. This multiplayer interaction produces a wide variation across game
trials, while also increasing the repeat playability for users. This paper
presents a demonstration of the MiBoard system and the expectations for its
application.",2010-09-12,2010,2010-09,education
Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing For A Mathematical Problem,"The paper proposes artificial intelligence technique called hill climbing to
find numerical solutions of Diophantine Equations. Such equations are important
as they have many applications in fields like public key cryptography, integer
factorization, algebraic curves, projective curves and data dependency in super
computers. Importantly, it has been proved that there is no general method to
find solutions of such equations. This paper is an attempt to find numerical
solutions of Diophantine equations using steepest ascent version of Hill
Climbing. The method, which uses tree representation to depict possible
solutions of Diophantine equations, adopts a novel methodology to generate
successors. The heuristic function used help to make the process of finding
solution as a minimization process. The work illustrates the effectiveness of
the proposed methodology using a class of Diophantine equations given by a1. x1
p1 + a2. x2 p2 + ...... + an . xn pn = N where ai and N are integers. The
experimental results validate that the procedure proposed is successful in
finding solutions of Diophantine Equations with sufficiently large powers and
large number of variables.",2010-10-02,2010,2010-10,education
Fundamentals of Mathematical Theory of Emotional Robots,"In this book we introduce a mathematically formalized concept of emotion,
robot's education and other psychological parameters of intelligent robots. We
also introduce unitless coefficients characterizing an emotional memory of a
robot. Besides, the effect of a robot's memory upon its emotional behavior is
studied, and theorems defining fellowship and conflicts in groups of robots are
proved. Also unitless parameters describing emotional states of those groups
are introduced, and a rule of making alternative (binary) decisions based on
emotional selection is given. We introduce a concept of equivalent educational
process for robots and a concept of efficiency coefficient of an educational
process, and suggest an algorithm of emotional contacts within a group of
robots. And generally, we present and describe a model of a virtual reality
with emotional robots. The book is meant for mathematical modeling specialists
and emotional robot software developers.",2010-10-17,2010,2010-10,education
Promoting scientific thinking with robots,"This article describes an exemplary robot exercise which was conducted in a
class for mechatronics students. The goal of this exercise was to engage
students in scientific thinking and reasoning, activities which do not always
play an important role in their curriculum. The robotic platform presented here
is simple in its construction and is customizable to the needs of the teacher.
Therefore, it can be used for exercises in many different fields of science,
not necessarily related to robotics. Here we present a situation where the
robot is used like an alien creature from which we want to understand its
behavior, resembling an ethological research activity. This robot exercise is
suited for a wide range of courses, from general introduction to science, to
hardware oriented lectures.",2011-08-22,2011,2011-08,education
Unfair items detection in educational measurement,"Measurement professionals cannot come to an agreement on the definition of
the term 'item fairness'. In this paper a continuous measure of item unfairness
is proposed. The more the unfairness measure deviates from zero, the less fair
the item is. If the measure exceeds the cutoff value, the item is identified as
definitely unfair. The new approach can identify unfair items that would not be
identified with conventional procedures. The results are in accord with
experts' judgments on the item qualities. Since no assumptions about scores
distributions and/or correlations are assumed, the method is applicable to any
educational test. Its performance is illustrated through application to scores
of a real test.",2012-02-11,2012,2012-02,education
Recommender System Based on Algorithm of Bicluster Analysis RecBi,"In this paper we propose two new algorithms based on biclustering analysis,
which can be used at the basis of a recommender system for educational
orientation of Russian School graduates. The first algorithm was designed to
help students make a choice between different university faculties when some of
their preferences are known. The second algorithm was developed for the special
situation when nothing is known about their preferences. The final version of
this recommender system will be used by Higher School of Economics.",2012-02-13,2012,2012-02,education
Isabelle/PIDE as Platform for Educational Tools,"The Isabelle/PIDE platform addresses the question whether proof assistants of
the LCF family are suitable as technological basis for educational tools. The
traditionally strong logical foundations of systems like HOL, Coq, or Isabelle
have so far been counter-balanced by somewhat inaccessible interaction via the
TTY (or minor variations like the well-known Proof General / Emacs interface).
Thus the fundamental question of math education tools with fully-formal
background theories has often been answered negatively due to accidental
weaknesses of existing proof engines.
  The idea of ""PIDE"" (which means ""Prover IDE"") is to integrate existing
provers like Isabelle into a larger environment, that facilitates access by
end-users and other tools. We use Scala to expose the proof engine in ML to the
JVM world, where many user-interfaces, editor frameworks, and educational tools
already exist. This shall ultimately lead to combined mathematical assistants,
where the logical engine is in the background, without obstructing the view on
applications of formal methods, formalized mathematics, and math education in
particular.",2012-02-22,2012,2012-02,education
RAPID: A Reachable Anytime Planner for Imprecisely-sensed Domains,"Despite the intractability of generic optimal partially observable Markov
decision process planning, there exist important problems that have highly
structured models. Previous researchers have used this insight to construct
more efficient algorithms for factored domains, and for domains with
topological structure in the flat state dynamics model. In our work, motivated
by findings from the education community relevant to automated tutoring, we
consider problems that exhibit a form of topological structure in the factored
dynamics model. Our Reachable Anytime Planner for Imprecisely-sensed Domains
(RAPID) leverages this structure to efficiently compute a good initial envelope
of reachable states under the optimal MDP policy in time linear in the number
of state variables. RAPID performs partially-observable planning over the
limited envelope of states, and slowly expands the state space considered as
time allows. RAPID performs well on a large tutoring-inspired problem
simulation with 122 state variables, corresponding to a flat state space of
over 10^30 states.",2012-03-15,2012,2012-03,education
Effects of Treatment on the Treated: Identification and Generalization,"Many applications of causal analysis call for assessing, retrospectively, the
effect of withholding an action that has in fact been implemented. This
counterfactual quantity, sometimes called ""effect of treatment on the treated,""
(ETT) have been used to to evaluate educational programs, critic public
policies, and justify individual decision making. In this paper we explore the
conditions under which ETT can be estimated from (i.e., identified in)
experimental and/or observational studies. We show that, when the action
invokes a singleton variable, the conditions for ETT identification have simple
characterizations in terms of causal diagrams. We further give a graphical
characterization of the conditions under which the effects of multiple
treatments on the treated can be identified, as well as ways in which the ETT
estimand can be constructed from both interventional and observational
distributions.",2012-05-09,2012,2012-05,education
Arabic CALL system based on pedagogically indexed text,"This article introduces the benefits of using computer as a tool for foreign
language teaching and learning. It describes the effect of using Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tools for learning Arabic. The technique explored in
this particular case is the employment of pedagogically indexed corpora. This
text-based method provides the teacher the advantage of building activities
based on texts adapted to a particular pedagogical situation. This paper also

create activities within their own pedagogical area of interest.",2012-07-10,2012,2012-07,education
Bayes Nets in Educational Assessment: Where Do the Numbers Come From?,"As observations and student models become complex, educational assessments
that exploit advances in technology and cognitive psychology can outstrip
familiar testing models and analytic methods. Within the Portal conceptual
framework for assessment design, Bayesian inference networks (BINs) record
beliefs about students' knowledge and skills, in light of what they say and do.
Joining evidence model BIN fragments- which contain observable variables and
pointers to student model variables - to the student model allows one to update
belief about knowledge and skills as observations arrive. Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) techniques can estimate the required conditional probabilities
from empirical data, supplemented by expert judgment or substantive theory.
Details for the special cases of item response theory (IRT) and multivariate
latent class modeling are given, with a numerical example of the latter.",2013-01-23,2013,2013-01,education
"A Rough Computing based Performance Evaluation Approach for Educational
  Institutions","Performance evaluation of various organizations especially educational
institutions is a very important area of research and needs to be cultivated
more. In this paper, we propose a performance evaluation for educational
institutions using rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces with ordering rules
and information entropy. In order to measure the performance of educational
institutions, we construct an evaluation index system. Rough set on fuzzy
approximation spaces with ordering is applied to explore the evaluation index
data of each level. Furthermore, the concept of information entropy is used to
determine the weighting coefficients of evaluation indexes. Also, we find the
most important indexes that influence the weighting coefficients. The proposed
approach is validated and shows the practical viability. Moreover, the proposed
approach can be applicable to any organizations.",2013-08-03,2013,2013-08,education
"Querying Geometric Figures Using a Controlled Language, Ontological
  Graphs and Dependency Lattices","Dynamic geometry systems (DGS) have become basic tools in many areas of
geometry as, for example, in education. Geometry Automated Theorem Provers
(GATP) are an active area of research and are considered as being basic tools
in future enhanced educational software as well as in a next generation of
mechanized mathematics assistants. Recently emerged Web repositories of
geometric knowledge, like TGTP and Intergeo, are an attempt to make the already
vast data set of geometric knowledge widely available. Considering the large
amount of geometric information already available, we face the need of a query
mechanism for descriptions of geometric constructions.
  In this paper we discuss two approaches for describing geometric figures
(declarative and procedural), and present algorithms for querying geometric
figures in declaratively and procedurally described corpora, by using a DGS or
a dedicated controlled natural language for queries.",2014-03-10,2014,2014-03,education
"Building a Classification Model for Enrollment In Higher Educational

Recently, one of the remarkable facts in higher educational institute is the
rapid growth data and this educational data is expanding quickly without any
advantage to the educational management. The main aim of the management is to
refine the education standard; therefore by applying the various data mining
techniques on this data one can get valuable information. This research study
proposed the ""classification model for the student's enrollment process in

Automated Generation of Geometric Theorems from Images of Diagrams,"We propose an approach to generate geometric theorems from electronic images
of diagrams automatically. The approach makes use of techniques of Hough
transform to recognize geometric objects and their labels and of numeric
verification to mine basic geometric relations. Candidate propositions are
generated from the retrieved information by using six strategies and geometric
theorems are obtained from the candidates via algebraic computation.
Experiments with a preliminary implementation illustrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed approach for generating nontrivial theorems from
images of diagrams. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automated
discovery of profound geometric knowledge from simple image data and has
potential applications in geometric knowledge management and education.",2014-06-06,2014,2014-06,education
$OntoMath^{PRO}$ Ontology: A Linked Data Hub for Mathematics,"In this paper, we present an ontology of mathematical knowledge concepts that

and education. We argue that the ontology can be a core of future integration
of math-aware data sets in the Web of Data and, therefore, provide mappings
onto relevant datasets, such as DBpedia and ScienceWISE.",2014-07-17,2014,2014-07,education
eTutor: Online Learning for Personalized Education,"Given recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence,
web-based education systems have became complementary and, in some cases,
viable alternatives to traditional classroom teaching. The popularity of these
systems stems from their ability to make education available to a large
demographics (see MOOCs). However, existing systems do not take advantage of
the personalization which becomes possible when web-based education is offered:
they continue to be one-size-fits-all. In this paper, we aim to provide a first
systematic method for designing a personalized web-based education system.
Personalizing education is challenging: (i) students need to be provided
personalized teaching and training depending on their contexts (e.g. classes
already taken, methods of learning preferred, etc.), (ii) for each specific
context, the best teaching and training method (e.g type and order of teaching
materials to be shown) must be learned, (iii) teaching and training should be
adapted online, based on the scores/feedback (e.g. tests, quizzes, final exam,
likes/dislikes etc.) of the students. Our personalized online system, e-Tutor,
is able to address these challenges by learning how to adapt the teaching
methodology (in this case what sequence of teaching material to present to a
student) to maximize her performance in the final exam, while minimizing the
time spent by the students to learn the course (and possibly dropouts). We
illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method on a real-world eTutor
platform which is used for remedial training for a Digital Signal Processing
(DSP) course.",2014-10-14,2014,2014-10,education
Deep Knowledge Tracing,"Knowledge tracing---where a machine models the knowledge of a student as they
interact with coursework---is a well established problem in computer supported
education. Though effectively modeling student knowledge would have high
educational impact, the task has many inherent challenges. In this paper we
explore the utility of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model student
learning. The RNN family of models have important advantages over previous
methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain
knowledge, and can capture more complex representations of student knowledge.
Using neural networks results in substantial improvements in prediction
performance on a range of knowledge tracing datasets. Moreover the learned
model can be used for intelligent curriculum design and allows straightforward
interpretation and discovery of structure in student tasks. These results
suggest a promising new line of research for knowledge tracing and an exemplary
application task for RNNs.",2015-06-19,2015,2015-06,education
"Automated Matchmaking to Improve Accuracy of Applicant Selection for
  University Education System","The accurate applicant selection for university education is imperative to
ensure fairness and optimal use of institutional resources. Although various
approaches are operational in tertiary educational institutions for selecting
applicants, a novel method of automated matchmaking is explored in the current
study. The method functions by matching a prospective students skills profile
to a programmes requisites profile.
  Empirical comparisons of the results, calculated by automated matchmaking and
two other selection methods, show matchmaking to be a viable alternative for
accurate selection of applicants. Matchmaking offers a unique advantage that it
neither requires data from other applicants nor compares applicants with each
other. Instead, it emphasises norms that define admissibility to a programme.
  We have proposed the use of technology to minimize the gap between students
aspirations, skill sets and course requirements. It is a solution to minimize
the number of students who get frustrated because of mismatched course
selection.",2015-07-09,2015,2015-07,education
Philosophical Fictionalism and Problem of Artificial Intelligence,"The artificial intelligence received broad interpretation as a literary

studies and mathematical investigations. An author applied methods peculiar to
the semiotic approach, offered by Boris Uspensky and Yury Lotman. In addition,
the article presented the criticism of modern versions of educational
technologies, which led to the unconditional expectations for possibilities of
information and telecommunication technologies. Methodological culture's
growth, which was described on the base of semiotics and functional approach to
word formation of new meanings for the description of the studied subjects,

Latent Skill Embedding for Personalized Lesson Sequence Recommendation,"Students in online courses generate large amounts of data that can be used to
personalize the learning process and improve quality of education. In this
paper, we present the Latent Skill Embedding (LSE), a probabilistic model of
students and educational content that can be used to recommend personalized
sequences of lessons with the goal of helping students prepare for specific
assessments. Akin to collaborative filtering for recommender systems, the
algorithm does not require students or content to be described by features, but
it learns a representation using access traces. We formulate this problem as a
regularized maximum-likelihood embedding of students, lessons, and assessments
from historical student-content interactions. An empirical evaluation on
large-scale data from Knewton, an adaptive learning technology company, shows
that this approach predicts assessment results competitively with benchmark
models and is able to discriminate between lesson sequences that lead to
mastery and failure.",2016-02-23,2016,2016-02,education
"An artificial intelligence tool for heterogeneous team formation in the
  classroom","Nowadays, there is increasing interest in the development of teamwork skills
in the educational context. This growing interest is motivated by its
pedagogical effectiveness and the fact that, in labour contexts, enterprises
organize their employees in teams to carry out complex projects. Despite its
crucial importance in the classroom and industry, there is a lack of support
for the team formation process. Not only do many factors influence team
performance, but the problem becomes exponentially costly if teams are to be
optimized. In this article, we propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a
gap. It combines artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure
generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin's role theory to facilitate the
generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool improves
current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes into account the
feedback of other teammates in order to establish the most predominant role of
a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty
with regard to each student's predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since
it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the
estimation of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool
in an experiment involving students that took part in three different team
activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to improve
different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student satisfaction.",2016-04-16,2016,2016-04,education
Human vs. Computer Go: Review and Prospect,"The Google DeepMind challenge match in March 2016 was a historic achievement
for computer Go development. This article discusses the development of
computational intelligence (CI) and its relative strength in comparison with
human intelligence for the game of Go. We first summarize the milestones
achieved for computer Go from 1998 to 2016. Then, the computer Go programs that
have participated in previous IEEE CIS competitions as well as methods and
techniques used in AlphaGo are briefly introduced. Commentaries from three
high-level professional Go players on the five AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol games

"Deploying learning materials to game content for serious education game
  development: A case study","The ultimate goals of serious education games (SEG) are to facilitate
learning and maximizing enjoyment during playing SEGs. In SEG development,
there are normally two spaces to be taken into account: knowledge space

effectively into game content becomes one of the most challenging problems in
SEG development. Unlike previous work where experts in education have to be
used heavily, we proposed a novel approach that works toward minimizing the
efforts of education experts in mapping learning materials to content space.
For a proof-of-concept, we apply the proposed approach in developing an SEG

decades. We find that discussion of AI has increased sharply since 2009, and
that these discussions have been consistently more optimistic than pessimistic.
However, when we examine specific concerns, we find that worries of loss of

"Team Formation for Scheduling Educational Material in Massive Online

of finding k group of students. The goal is to teach students within time frame
d such that their potential for learning is maximized and find the best

"Applying Artificial Intelligence and Internet Techniques in Rural
  Tourism Domain","Society has become more dependent on automated intelligent systems, at the
same time, these systems have become more and more complicated. Society's
expectation regarding the capabilities and intelligence of such systems has
also grown. We have become a more complicated society with more complicated
problems. As the expectation of intelligent systems rises, we discover many
more applications for artificial intelligence. Additionally, as the difficulty
level and computational requirements of such problems rise, there is a need to
distribute the problem solving. Although the field of multiagent systems (MAS)
and distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is relatively young, the
importance and applicability of this technology for solving today's problems
continue to grow. In multiagent systems, the main goal is to provide fruitful
cooperation among agents in order to enrich the support given to all user
activities. This paper deals with the development of a multiagent system aimed
at solving the reservation problems encountered in rural tourism. Due to their
benefits over the last few years, online travel agencies have become a very
useful instrument in planning vacations. A MAS concept (which is based on the
Internet exploitation) can improve this activity and provide clients with a

"A Framework for Easing the Development of Applications Embedding Answer
  Set Programming","Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-established declarative problem
solving paradigm which became widely used in AI and recognized as a powerful
tool for knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR), especially for its high
expressiveness and the ability to deal also with incomplete knowledge.
  Recently, thanks to the availability of a number of robust and efficient
implementations, ASP has been increasingly employed in a number of different
domains, and used for the development of industrial-level and enterprise
applications. This made clear the need for proper development tools and
interoperability mechanisms for easing interaction and integration with
external systems in the widest range of real-world scenarios, including mobile
applications and educational contexts.
  In this work we present a framework for integrating the KRR capabilities of
ASP into generic applications. We show the use of the framework by illustrating
proper specializations for some relevant ASP systems over different platforms,

"Object-Oriented Sokoban Solver: A Serious Game Project for OOAD and AI
  Education","Serious games are beneficial for education in various computer science areas.
Numerous works have reported the experiences of using games (not only playing
but also development) in teaching and learning. Considering it could be
difficult for teachers/students to prepare/develop a game from scratch during
one semester, assistant educational materials would be crucial in the
corresponding courses. Unfortunately, the literature shows that not many
materials from educational game projects are shared. To help different
educators identify suitable courseware and help students implement game
development, it is worth further investigating and accumulating the educational
resources from individual game projects. Following such an idea, this paper
proposes a game development project of an object-oriented Sokoban solver, and
exposes relevant educational materials. The documented system design can be
viewed as a ready-to-use resource for education in object-oriented analysis and
design (OOAD), while the Sokoban solver itself may be used as an assignment
platform for teaching artificial intelligence (AI). Further documentation,
platform, and APIs will be realized and shared in the future to facilitate

Difficulty-level Modeling of Ontology-based Factual Questions,"Semantics based knowledge representations such as ontologies are found to be
very useful in automatically generating meaningful factual questions.
Determining the difficulty level of these system generated questions is helpful
to effectively utilize them in various educational and professional

factual questions are very simple and are limited to a few basic principles. We
propose a new methodology for this problem by considering an educational theory
called Item Response Theory (IRT). In the IRT, knowledge proficiency of end
users (learners) are considered for assigning difficulty levels, because of the
assumptions that a given question is perceived differently by learners of
various proficiencies. We have done a detailed study on the features (factors)
of a question statement which could possibly determine its difficulty level for
three learner categories (experts, intermediates and beginners). We formulate
ontology based metrics for the same. We then train three logistic regression
models to predict the difficulty level corresponding to the three learner

Learning to Rank based on Analogical Reasoning,"Object ranking or ""learning to rank"" is an important problem in the realm of
preference learning. On the basis of training data in the form of a set of
rankings of objects represented as feature vectors, the goal is to learn a
ranking function that predicts a linear order of any new set of objects. In
this paper, we propose a new approach to object ranking based on principles of
analogical reasoning. More specifically, our inference pattern is formalized in
terms of so-called analogical proportions and can be summarized as follows:
Given objects $A,B,C,D$, if object $A$ is known to be preferred to $B$, and $C$
relates to $D$ as $A$ relates to $B$, then $C$ is (supposedly) preferred to
$D$. Our method applies this pattern as a main building block and combines it
with ideas and techniques from instance-based learning and rank aggregation.
Based on first experimental results for data sets from various domains (sports,
education, tourism, etc.), we conclude that our approach is highly competitive.
It appears to be specifically interesting in situations in which the objects
are coming from different subdomains, and which hence require a kind of
knowledge transfer.",2017-11-28,2017,2017-11,education
Happiness Pursuit: Personality Learning in a Society of Agents,"Modeling personality is a challenging problem with applications spanning
computer games, virtual assistants, online shopping and education. Many
techniques have been tried, ranging from neural networks to computational
cognitive architectures. However, most approaches rely on examples with
hand-crafted features and scenarios. Here, we approach learning a personality
by training agents using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model on rewards based on
psychoanalysis, against hand-coded AI in the game of Pong. As a result, we
obtain 4 agents, each with its own personality. Then, we define happiness of an
agent, which can be seen as a measure of alignment with agent's objective
function, and study it when agents play both against hand-coded AI, and against
each other. We find that the agents that achieve higher happiness during
testing against hand-coded AI, have lower happiness when competing against each
other. This suggests that higher happiness in testing is a sign of overfitting
in learning to interact with hand-coded AI, and leads to worse performance
against agents with different personalities.",2017-11-29,2017,2017-11,education
"Towards the Augmented Pathologist: Challenges of Explainable-AI in

records, and *omics data) together with current advances in artificial
intelligence/machine learning enable to make novel information accessible and
quantifiable to a human expert, which is not yet available and not exploited in
current medical settings. The grand goal is to reach a level of usable
intelligence to understand the data in the context of an application task,
thereby making machine decisions transparent, interpretable and explainable.
The foundation of such an ""augmented pathologist"" needs an integrated approach:
While machine learning algorithms require many thousands of training examples,
a human expert is often confronted with only a few data points. Interestingly,
humans can learn from such few examples and are able to instantly interpret
complex patterns. Consequently, the grand goal is to combine the possibilities
of artificial intelligence with human intelligence and to find a well-suited
balance between them to enable what neither of them could do on their own. This
can raise the quality of education, diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of
cancer and other diseases. In this paper we describe some (incomplete) research

"An Ontology Based Modeling Framework for Design of Educational

data from a conventional test and an item response theory. First, we apply a
GS-based parameter estimation mechanism to estimate the items parameters
according to the response data, and then to compare its results with those of
an IRT-based Bayesian parameter estimation mechanism. In addition, we propose a
static-IRT test assembly mechanism to assemble a form for the conventional

probability of making a correct response to the item for a student with various
abilities. Moreover, this paper also proposes a novel PFML learning mechanism
for optimizing the parameters between items and students. Finally, we adopt a
K-fold cross validation mechanism to evaluate the performance of the proposed

Analogy-Based Preference Learning with Kernels,"Building on a specific formalization of analogical relationships of the form

"Solving The Exam Scheduling Problems in Central Exams With Genetic
  Algorithms","It is the efficient use of resources expected from an exam scheduling
application. There are various criteria for efficient use of resources and for
all tests to be carried out at minimum cost in the shortest possible time. It
is aimed that educational institutions with such criteria successfully carry
out central examination organizations. In the study, a two-stage genetic
algorithm was developed. In the first stage, the assignment of courses to
sessions was carried out. In the second stage, the students who participated in
the test session were assigned to examination rooms. Purposes of the study are
increasing the number of joint students participating in sessions, using the
minimum number of buildings in the same session, and reducing the number of
supervisors using the minimum number of classrooms possible. In this study, a
general purpose exam scheduling solution for educational institutions was
presented. The developed system can be used in different central examinations
to create originality. Given the results of the sample application, it is seen
that the proposed genetic algorithm gives successful results.1",2019-02-04,2019,2019-02,education

"Emotion Recognition in Conversation: Research Challenges, Datasets, and
  Recent Advances","Emotion is intrinsic to humans and consequently emotion understanding is a
key part of human-like artificial intelligence (AI). Emotion recognition in
conversation (ERC) is becoming increasingly popular as a new research frontier
in natural language processing (NLP) due to its ability to mine opinions from
the plethora of publicly available conversational data in platforms such as
Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, Twitter, and others. Moreover, it has potential
applications in health-care systems (as a tool for psychological analysis),
education (understanding student frustration) and more. Additionally, ERC is
also extremely important for generating emotion-aware dialogues that require an
understanding of the user's emotions. Catering to these needs calls for
effective and scalable conversational emotion-recognition algorithms. However,
it is a strenuous problem to solve because of several research challenges. In

the reasons why they fail to successfully overcome the research challenges in
ERC.",2019-05-08,2019,2019-05,education
Ludii -- The Ludemic General Game System,"While current General Game Playing (GGP) systems facilitate useful research

structures of ludemes -- high-level, easily understandable game concepts --
which allows for concise and human-understandable game descriptions. We
formally describe Ludii and outline its main benefits: generality,
extensibility, understandability and efficiency. Experimentally, Ludii
outperforms one of the most efficient Game Description Language (GDL)
reasoners, based on a propositional network, in all games available in the
Tiltyard GGP repository. Moreover, Ludii is also competitive in terms of

"Digital Normativity: A challenge for human subjectivization and free
  will","Over the past decade, artificial intelligence has demonstrated its efficiency
in many different applications and a huge number of algorithms have become
central and ubiquitous in our life. Their growing interest is essentially based
on their capability to synthesize and process large amounts of data, and to
help humans making decisions in a world of increasing complexity. Yet, the
effectiveness of algorithms in bringing more and more relevant recommendations
to humans may start to compete with human-alone decisions based on values other
than pure efficacy. Here, we examine this tension in light of the emergence of
several forms of digital normativity, and analyze how this normative role of AI
may influence the ability of humans to remain subject of their life. The advent
of AI technology imposes a need to achieve a balance between concrete material
progress and progress of the mind to avoid any form of servitude. It has become
essential that an ethical reflection accompany the current developments of

we propose a refined hierarchical knowledge structure to model vocabulary
knowledge, which enables us to automatically organize the authentic and
up-to-date learning materials collected from the internet. Based on this

"A Self-Attention Joint Model for Spoken Language Understanding in
  Situational Dialog Applications","Spoken language understanding (SLU) acts as a critical component in
goal-oriented dialog systems. It typically involves identifying the speakers
intent and extracting semantic slots from user utterances, which are known as
intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF). SLU problem has been intensively
investigated in recent years. However, these methods just constrain SF results
grammatically, solve ID and SF independently, or do not fully utilize the
mutual impact of the two tasks. This paper proposes a multi-head self-attention
joint model with a conditional random field (CRF) layer and a prior mask. The
experiments show the effectiveness of our model, as compared with
state-of-the-art models. Meanwhile, online education in China has made great
progress in the last few years. But there are few intelligent educational

"A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Towards Medical
  XAI","Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning in general have
demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to
natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning. Along
with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and
disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus
transparency, for example the medical sector. Explanations for machine
decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This
requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the
mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the
deep learning is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly
understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different
research works and categorize them. The different categories show different
dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide
""obviously"" interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By
applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is
hoped that (1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these

However, in addition to sequential information, questions inherently exhibit
side relations, which can enrich our understandings about student knowledge
states and has great potentials to advance knowledge tracing. Thus, in this

Automatic Short Answer Grading via Multiway Attention Networks,"Automatic short answer grading (ASAG), which autonomously score student

two reasons: (1) student answers are made up of free text which requires a deep
semantic understanding; and (2) the questions are usually open-ended and across
many domains in K-12 scenarios. In this paper, we propose a generalized
end-to-end ASAG learning framework which aims to (1) autonomously extract
linguistic information from both student and reference answers; and (2)
accurately model the semantic relations between free-text student and reference

Joint Embedding Learning of Educational Knowledge Graphs,"As an efficient model for knowledge organization, the knowledge graph has
been widely adopted in several fields, e.g., biomedicine, sociology, and
education. And there is a steady trend of learning embedding representations of
knowledge graphs to facilitate knowledge graph construction and downstream
tasks. In general, knowledge graph embedding techniques aim to learn vectorized
representations which preserve the structural information of the graph. And
conventional embedding learning models rely on structural relationships among
entities and relations. However, in educational knowledge graphs, structural
relationships are not the focus. Instead, rich literals of the graphs are more
valuable. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a novel model for
embedding learning of educational knowledge graphs. Our model considers both
structural and literal information and jointly learns embedding
representations. Three experimental graphs were constructed based on an
educational knowledge graph which has been applied in real-world teaching. We

"TrueLearn: A Family of Bayesian Algorithms to Match Lifelong Learners to
  Open Educational Resources","The recent advances in computer-assisted learning systems and the
availability of open educational resources today promise a pathway to providing
cost-efficient, high-quality education to large masses of learners. One of the
most ambitious use cases of computer-assisted learning is to build a lifelong
learning recommendation system. Unlike short-term courses, lifelong learning
presents unique challenges, requiring sophisticated recommendation models that
account for a wide range of factors such as background knowledge of learners or
novelty of the material while effectively maintaining knowledge states of
masses of learners for significantly longer periods of time (ideally, a
lifetime). This work presents the foundations towards building a dynamic,
scalable and transparent recommendation system for education, modelling
learner's knowledge from implicit data in the form of engagement with open
educational resources. We i) use a text ontology based on Wikipedia to
automatically extract knowledge components of educational resources and, ii)
propose a set of online Bayesian strategies inspired by the well-known areas of
item response theory and knowledge tracing. Our proposal, TrueLearn, focuses on
recommendations for which the learner has enough background knowledge (so they
are able to understand and learn from the material), and the material has
enough novelty that would help the learner improve their knowledge about the
subject and keep them engaged. We further construct a large open educational

EdNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset in Education,"With advances in Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) and the
ever-growing scale of Interactive Educational Systems (IESs), data-driven
approach has become a common recipe for various tasks such as knowledge tracing

interaction data is often challenging, which results in the lack of public
large-scale benchmark dataset reflecting a wide variety of student behaviors in
modern IESs. Although several datasets, such as ASSISTments, Junyi Academy,
Synthetic and STATICS, are publicly available and widely used, they are not
large enough to leverage the full potential of state-of-the-art data-driven
models and limits the recorded behaviors to question-solving activities. To
this end, we introduce EdNet, a large-scale hierarchical dataset of diverse
student activities collected by Santa, a multi-platform self-study solution
equipped with artificial intelligence tutoring system. EdNet contains
131,441,538 interactions from 784,309 students collected over more than 2

"Assessment Modeling: Fundamental Pre-training Tasks for Interactive
  Educational Systems","Like many other domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), there are specific
tasks in the field of AI in Education (AIEd) for which labels are scarce and
expensive, such as predicting exam score or review correctness. A common way of
circumventing label-scarce problems is pre-training a model to learn
representations of the contents of learning items. However, such methods fail
to utilize the full range of student interaction data available and do not
model student learning behavior. To this end, we propose Assessment Modeling, a
class of fundamental pre-training tasks for general interactive educational
systems. An assessment is a feature of student-system interactions which can
serve as a pedagogical evaluation. Examples include the correctness and
timeliness of a student's answer. Assessment Modeling is the prediction of
assessments conditioned on the surrounding context of interactions. Although it
is natural to pre-train on interactive features available in large amounts,
limiting the prediction targets to assessments focuses the tasks' relevance to
the label-scarce educational problems and reduces less-relevant noise. While
the effectiveness of different combinations of assessments is open for
exploration, we suggest Assessment Modeling as a first-order guiding principle
for selecting proper pre-training tasks for label-scarce educational problems.",2020-01-01,2020,2020-01,education
Algorithmic Fairness,"An increasing number of decisions regarding the daily lives of human beings

bias and unfairness and the common definitions and measures for fairness.
Fairness-enhancing mechanisms are then reviewed and divided into pre-process,

"Combining high-performance hardware, cloud computing, and deep learning
  frameworks to accelerate physical simulations: probing the Hopfield network","The synthesis of high-performance computing (particularly graphics processing
units), cloud computing services (like Google Colab), and high-level deep
learning frameworks (such as PyTorch) has powered the burgeoning field of
artificial intelligence. While these technologies are popular in the computer
science discipline, the physics community is less aware of how such
innovations, freely available online, can improve research and education. In
this tutorial, we take the Hopfield network as an example to show how the
confluence of these fields can dramatically accelerate physics-based computer
simulations and remove technical barriers in implementing such programs,
thereby making physics experimentation and education faster and more
accessible. To do so, we introduce the cloud, the GPU, and AI frameworks that
can be easily repurposed for physics simulation. We then introduce the Hopfield
network and explain how to produce large-scale simulations and visualizations
for free in the cloud with very little code (fully self-contained in the text).

"Automating the Generation of High School Geometry Proofs using Prolog in
  an Educational Context","When working on intelligent tutor systems designed for mathematics education
and its specificities, an interesting objective is to provide relevant help to
the students by anticipating their next steps. This can only be done by
knowing, beforehand, the possible ways to solve a problem. Hence the need for
an automated theorem prover that provide proofs as they would be written by a
student. To achieve this objective, logic programming is a natural tool due to
the similarity of its reasoning with a mathematical proof by inference. In this
paper, we present the core ideas we used to implement such a prover, from its
encoding in Prolog to the generation of the complete set of proofs. However,
when dealing with educational aspects, there are many challenges to overcome.
We also present the main issues we encountered, as well as the chosen
solutions.",2020-02-28,2020,2020-02,education

"Choose Your Own Question: Encouraging Self-Personalization in Learning
  Path Construction","Learning Path Recommendation is the heart of adaptive learning, the
educational paradigm of an Interactive Educational System (IES) providing a
personalized learning experience based on the student's history of learning
activities. In typical existing IESs, the student must fully consume a
recommended learning item to be provided a new recommendation. This workflow
comes with several limitations. For example, there is no opportunity for the
student to give feedback on the choice of learning items made by the IES.
Furthermore, the mechanism by which the choice is made is opaque to the
student, limiting the student's ability to track their learning. To this end,
we introduce Rocket, a Tinder-like User Interface for a general class of IESs.
Rocket provides a visual representation of Artificial Intelligence
(AI)-extracted features of learning materials, allowing the student to quickly
decide whether the material meets their needs. The student can choose between
engaging with the material and receiving a new recommendation by swiping or
tapping. Rocket offers the following potential improvements for IES User
Interfaces: First, Rocket enhances the explainability of IES recommendations by
showing students a visual summary of the meaningful AI-extracted features used
in the decision-making process. Second, Rocket enables self-personalization of
the learning experience by leveraging the students' knowledge of their own
abilities and needs. Finally, Rocket provides students with fine-grained
information on their learning path, giving them an avenue to assess their own
skills and track their learning progress. We present the source code of Rocket,

make it publicly available for all purposes.",2020-05-08,2020,2020-05,education
Siamese Neural Networks for Class Activity Detection,"Classroom activity detection (CAD) aims at accurately recognizing speaker
roles (either teacher or student) in classrooms. A CAD solution helps teachers
get instant feedback on their pedagogical instructions. However, CAD is very
challenging because (1) classroom conversations contain many conversational
turn-taking overlaps between teachers and students; (2) the CAD model needs to
be generalized well enough for different teachers and students; and (3)
classroom recordings may be very noisy and low-quality. In this work, we
address the above challenges by building a Siamese neural framework to
automatically identify teacher and student utterances from classroom
recordings. The proposed model is evaluated on real-world educational datasets.
The results demonstrate that (1) our approach is superior on the prediction
tasks for both online and offline classroom environments; and (2) our framework
exhibits robustness and generalization ability on new teachers (i.e., teachers
never appear in training data).",2020-05-15,2020,2020-05,education

remarkably help teachers improve their overall teaching quality over time in
classrooms. Therefore, in this work, we build an end-to-end neural framework
that automatically detects questions from teachers' audio recordings. Compared
with traditional methods, our approach not only avoids cumbersome feature
engineering, but also adapts to the task of multi-class question detection in
real education scenarios. By incorporating multi-task learning techniques, we
are able to strengthen the understanding of semantic relations among different
types of questions. We conducted extensive experiments on the question

Predicting Engagement in Video Lectures,"The explosion of Open Educational Resources (OERs) in the recent years
creates the demand for scalable, automatic approaches to process and evaluate
OERs, with the end goal of identifying and recommending the most suitable

characteristics and features involved in context-agnostic engagement (i.e.
population-based), a seldom researched topic compared to other contextualised
and personalised approaches that focus more on individual learner engagement.
Learner engagement, is arguably a more reliable measure than popularity/number
of views, is more abundant than user ratings and has also been shown to be a
crucial component in achieving learning outcomes. In this work, we explore the
idea of building a predictive model for population-based engagement in
education. We introduce a novel, large dataset of video lectures for predicting
context-agnostic engagement and propose both cross-modal and modality-specific
feature sets to achieve this task. We further test different strategies for
quantifying learner engagement signals. We demonstrate the use of our approach

"Disparate Impact of Artificial Intelligence Bias in Ridehailing
  Economy's Price Discrimination Algorithms","Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to
inform smart city planning predict each trip's fare pricing with automated
algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence (AI). This type of AI
algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the
industry's black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking
transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has
not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of
price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency
in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation
providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the
first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination
algorithms used by ridehailing applications.
  The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature
combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract
attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100
million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant
disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from
ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes.
Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger
residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher
fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32,
-0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively. Further, our methods

"Measuring the Credibility of Student Attendance Data in Higher Education
  for Data Mining","Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a developing discipline, concerned with
expanding the classical Data Mining (DM) methods and developing new methods for
discovering the data that originate from educational systems. Student
attendance in higher education has always been dealt with in a classical way,
educators rely on counting the occurrence of attendance or absence building
their knowledge about students as well as modules based on this count. This
method is neither credible nor does it necessarily provide a real indication of
a student performance. This study tries to formulate the extracted knowledge in
a way that guarantees achieving accurate and credible results. Student
attendance data, gathered from the educational system, were first cleaned in
order to remove any randomness and noise, then various attributes were studied
so as to highlight the most significant ones that affect the real attendance of
students. The next step was to derive an equation that measures the Student
Attendance Credibility (SAC) considering the attributes chosen in the previous
step. The reliability of the newly developed measure was then evaluated in
order to examine its consistency. Finally, the J48 DM classification technique
was utilized in order to classify modules based on the strength of their SAC
values. Results of this study were promising, and credibility values achieved

Higher Education Institutions and researches have extensively investigated some
of the well-known combinatorial problems such as the timetabling and student

Education Institutions are not only confined to these categories of
combinatorial problems. The majority of NP-hard problems faced in institutions
involve grouping students and/or resources, albeit with each problem having its
own unique set of constraints. Thus, it can be argued that techniques to solve
NP-hard problems in Higher Education Institutions can be transferred across the

(ABSA) has emerged. Having the ability to extract the polarity for each aspect
of opinions separately, ABSA has found itself useful in a wide range of
domains. Education is one of the domains in which ABSA can be successfully
utilized. Being able to understand and find out what students like and don't
like most about a course, professor, or teaching methodology can be of great
importance for the respective institutions. While this task represents a unique
NLP challenge, many studies have proposed different approaches to tackle the

in ABSA with a focus in the education domain. A wide range of methodologies are
discussed and conclusions are drawn.",2020-10-03,2020,2020-10,education
Kartta Labs: Collaborative Time Travel,"We introduce the modular and scalable design of Kartta Labs, an open source,
open data, and scalable system for virtually reconstructing cities from
historical maps and photos. Kartta Labs relies on crowdsourcing and artificial
intelligence consisting of two major modules: Maps and 3D models. Each module,
in turn, consists of sub-modules that enable the system to reconstruct a city
from historical maps and photos. The result is a spatiotemporal reference that
can be used to integrate various collected data (curated, sensed, or
crowdsourced) for research, education, and entertainment purposes. The system
empowers the users to experience collaborative time travel such that they work
together to reconstruct the past and experience it on an open source and open
data platform.",2020-10-07,2020,2020-10,education

"Proceedings 9th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for
  Educational Software","The 9th International Workshop on Theorem-Proving Components for Educational
Software (ThEdu'20) was scheduled to happen on June 29 as a satellite of the
IJCAR-FSCD 2020 joint meeting, in Paris. The COVID-19 pandemic came by
surprise, though, and the main conference was virtualised. Fearing that an
online meeting would not allow our community to fully reproduce the usual
face-to-face networking opportunities of the ThEdu initiative, the Steering
Committee of ThEdu decided to cancel our workshop. Given that many of us had
already planned and worked for that moment, we decided that ThEdu'20 could
still live in the form of an EPTCS volume. The EPTCS concurred with us,
recognising this very singular situation, and accepted our proposal of
organising a special issue with papers submitted to ThEdu'20. An open call for
papers was then issued, and attracted five submissions, all of which have been
accepted by our reviewers, who produced three careful reports on each of the
contributions. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present
volume. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will help
further promoting the development of theorem-proving-based software, and that
it will collaborate to improve the mutual understanding between computer
mathematicians and stakeholders in education. With some luck, we would actually
expect that the very special circumstances set up by the worst sanitary crisis
in a century will happen to reinforce the need for the application of certified

Personalized Multimodal Feedback Generation in Education,"The automatic evaluation for school assignments is an important application
of AI in the education field. In this work, we focus on the task of
personalized multimodal feedback generation, which aims to generate
personalized feedback for various teachers to evaluate students' assignments

involves the representation and fusion of multimodal information and natural
language generation, which presents the challenges from three aspects: 1) how
to encode and integrate multimodal inputs; 2) how to generate feedback specific
to each modality; and 3) how to realize personalized feedback generation. In
this paper, we propose a novel Personalized Multimodal Feedback Generation
Network (PMFGN) armed with a modality gate mechanism and a personalized bias
mechanism to address these challenges. The extensive experiments on real-world
K-12 education data show that our model significantly outperforms several
baselines by generating more accurate and diverse feedback. In addition,
detailed ablation experiments are conducted to deepen our understanding of the

"Good proctor or ""Big Brother""? AI Ethics and Online Exam Supervision
  Technologies","This article philosophically analyzes online exam supervision technologies,
which have been thrust into the public spotlight due to campus lockdowns during
the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing demand for online courses. Online exam
proctoring technologies purport to provide effective oversight of students
sitting online exams, using artificial intelligence (AI) systems and human
invigilators to supplement and review those systems. Such technologies have
alarmed some students who see them as `Big Brother-like', yet some universities
defend their judicious use. Critical ethical appraisal of online proctoring
technologies is overdue. This article philosophically analyzes these
technologies, focusing on the ethical concepts of academic integrity, fairness,
non-maleficence, transparency, privacy, respect for autonomy, liberty, and

Automated Large-scale Class Scheduling in MiniZinc,"Class Scheduling is a highly constrained task. Educational institutes spend a
lot of resources, in the form of time and manual computation, to find a
satisficing schedule that fulfills all the requirements. A satisficing class
schedule accommodates all the students to all their desired courses at
convenient timing. The scheduler also needs to take into account the
availability of course teachers on the given slots. With the added limitation
of available classrooms, the number of solutions satisfying all constraints in
this huge search-space, further decreases.
  This paper proposes an efficient system to generate class schedules that can
fulfill every possible need of a typical university. Though it is primarily a
fixed-credit scheduler, it can be adjusted for open-credit systems as well. The
model is designed in MiniZinc and solved using various off-the-shelf solvers.
The proposed scheduling system can find a balanced schedule for a

these ML systems. Our main contributions include a) We introduce GYC, a
framework to generate counterfactual samples such that the generation is
plausible, diverse, goal-oriented, and effective, b) We generate counterfactual
samples, that can direct the generation towards a corresponding condition such
as named-entity tag, semantic role label, or sentiment. Our experimental

Towards Continual Reinforcement Learning: A Review and Perspectives,"In this article, we aim to provide a literature review of different
formulations and approaches to continual reinforcement learning (RL), also
known as lifelong or non-stationary RL. We begin by discussing our perspective
on why RL is a natural fit for studying continual learning. We then provide a
taxonomy of different continual RL formulations by mathematically
characterizing two key properties of non-stationarity, namely, the scope and
driver non-stationarity. This offers a unified view of various formulations.
Next, we review and present a taxonomy of continual RL approaches. We go on to
discuss evaluation of continual RL agents, providing an overview of benchmarks
used in the literature and important metrics for understanding agent
performance. Finally, we highlight open problems and challenges in bridging the
gap between the current state of continual RL and findings in neuroscience.
While still in its early days, the study of continual RL has the promise to
develop better incremental reinforcement learners that can function in
increasingly realistic applications where non-stationarity plays a vital role.

traditional learning is that it cannot be suited to every student in class.
Some students may grasp the concepts well, while some may have difficulties in
understanding them and some may be more auditory or visual learners. The World

IES to develop learner performance models is increasing rapidly. Moreover, with
the advances in computing systems, the amount of data captured by these IES
systems is also increasing that enables deep learning models to compete with
traditional logistic models and Markov processes. However, it is still not
empirically evident if these deep models outperform traditional models on the
current scale of datasets with millions of student interactions. In this work,
we adopt EdNet, the largest student interaction dataset publicly available in

A Framework for Ethical AI at the United Nations,"This paper aims to provide an overview of the ethical concerns in artificial
intelligence (AI) and the framework that is needed to mitigate those risks, and
to suggest a practical path to ensure the development and use of AI at the
United Nations (UN) aligns with our ethical values. The overview discusses how
AI is an increasingly powerful tool with potential for good, albeit one with a
high risk of negative side-effects that go against fundamental human rights and
UN values. It explains the need for ethical principles for AI aligned with
principles for data governance, as data and AI are tightly interwoven. It
explores different ethical frameworks that exist and tools such as assessment
lists. It recommends that the UN develop a framework consisting of ethical
principles, architectural standards, assessment methods, tools and
methodologies, and a policy to govern the implementation and adherence to this
framework, accompanied by an education program for staff.",2021-04-09,2021,2021-04,education
Accelerating science with human versus alien artificial intelligences,"Data-driven artificial intelligence models fed with published scientific
findings have been used to create powerful prediction engines for scientific
and technological advance, such as the discovery of novel materials with
desired properties and the targeted invention of new therapies and vaccines.
These AI approaches typically ignore the distribution of human prediction
engines -- scientists and inventor -- who continuously alter the landscape of
discovery and invention. As a result, AI hypotheses are designed to substitute
for human experts, failing to complement them for punctuated collective
advance. Here we show that incorporating the distribution of human expertise
into self-supervised models by training on inferences cognitively available to
experts dramatically improves AI prediction of future human discoveries and
inventions. Including expert-awareness into models that propose (a) valuable
energy-relevant materials increases the precision of materials predictions by
~100%, (b) repurposing thousands of drugs to treat new diseases increases
precision by 43%, and (c) COVID-19 vaccine candidates examined in clinical
trials by 260%. These models succeed by predicting human predictions and the
scientists who will make them. By tuning AI to avoid the crowd, however, it
generates scientifically promising ""alien"" hypotheses unlikely to be imagined
or pursued without intervention, not only accelerating but punctuating
scientific advance. By identifying and correcting for collective human bias,
these models also suggest opportunities to improve human prediction by
reformulating science education for discovery.",2021-04-12,2021,2021-04,education

"Equity and Artificial Intelligence in Education: Will ""AIEd"" Amplify or
  Alleviate Inequities in Education?","The development of educational AI (AIEd) systems has often been motivated by
their potential to promote educational equity and reduce achievement gaps
across different groups of learners -- for example, by scaling up the benefits
of one-on-one human tutoring to a broader audience, or by filling gaps in
existing educational services. Given these noble intentions, why might AIEd
systems have inequitable impacts in practice? In this chapter, we discuss four
lenses that can be used to examine how and why AIEd systems risk amplifying
existing inequities. Building from these lenses, we then outline possible paths
towards more equitable futures for AIEd, while highlighting debates surrounding
each proposal. In doing so, we hope to provoke new conversations around the
design of equitable AIEd, and to push ongoing conversations in the field
forward.",2021-04-27,2021,2021-04,education
Towards Equity and Algorithmic Fairness in Student Grade Prediction,"Equity of educational outcome and fairness of AI with respect to race have
been topics of increasing importance in education. In this work, we address
both with empirical evaluations of grade prediction in higher education, an
important task to improve curriculum design, plan interventions for academic
support, and offer course guidance to students. With fairness as the aim, we
trial several strategies for both label and instance balancing to attempt to
minimize differences in algorithm performance with respect to race. We find
that an adversarial learning approach, combined with grade label balancing,
achieved by far the fairest results. With equity of educational outcome as the
aim, we trial strategies for boosting predictive performance on historically
underserved groups and find success in sampling those groups in inverse
proportion to their historic outcomes. With AI-infused technology supports
increasingly prevalent on campuses, our methodologies fill a need for
frameworks to consider performance trade-offs with respect to sensitive student
attributes and allow institutions to instrument their AI resources in ways that
are attentive to equity and fairness.",2021-05-14,2021,2021-05,education
Modeling the EdNet Dataset with Logistic Regression,"Many of these challenges are won by neural network models created by

educational data mining, a field founded in the learning sciences and connected
with roots in psychology and statistics. We describe our efforts from the
perspectives of learning scientists and the challenges to our methods, some
real and some imagined. We also discuss some basic results in the Kaggle system
and our thoughts on how those results may have been improved. Finally, we
describe how learner model predictions are used to make pedagogical decisions
for students. Their practical use entails a) model predictions and b) a
decision rule (based on the predictions). We point out how increased model
accuracy can be of limited practical utility, especially when paired with

optimal decision rules.",2021-05-17,2021,2021-05,education
"Beyond ""Fairness:"" Structural (In)justice Lenses on AI for Education","Educational technologies, and the systems of schooling in which they are
deployed, enact particular ideologies about what is important to know and how
learners should learn. As artificial intelligence technologies -- in education
and beyond -- may contribute to inequitable outcomes for marginalized
communities, various approaches have been developed to evaluate and mitigate
the harmful impacts of AI. However, we argue in this paper that the dominant
paradigm of evaluating fairness on the basis of performance disparities in AI
models is inadequate for confronting the systemic inequities that educational
AI systems (re)produce. We draw on a lens of structural injustice informed by
critical theory and Black feminist scholarship to critically interrogate
several widely-studied and widely-adopted categories of educational AI and
explore how they are bound up in and reproduce historical legacies of
structural injustice and inequity, regardless of the parity of their models'
performance. We close with alternative visions for a more equitable future for
educational AI.",2021-05-18,2021,2021-05,education
Classifying Math KCs via Task-Adaptive Pre-Trained BERT,"Educational content labeled with proper knowledge components (KCs) are
particularly useful to teachers or content organizers. However, manually
labeling educational content is labor intensive and error-prone. To address
this challenge, prior research proposed machine learning based solutions to
auto-label educational content with limited success. In this work, we
significantly improve prior research by (1) expanding the input types to
include KC descriptions, instructional video titles, and problem descriptions
(i.e., three types of prediction task), (2) doubling the granularity of the
prediction from 198 to 385 KC labels (i.e., more practical setting but much
harder multinomial classification problem), (3) improving the prediction
accuracies by 0.5-2.3% using Task-adaptive Pre-trained BERT, outperforming six
baselines, and (4) proposing a simple evaluation measure by which we can
recover 56-73% of mispredicted KC labels. All codes and data sets in the

Towards Teachable Autotelic Agents,"Autonomous discovery and direct instruction are two distinct sources of
learning in children but education sciences demonstrate that mixed approaches
such as assisted discovery or guided play result in improved skill acquisition.
In the field of Artificial Intelligence, these extremes respectively map to
autonomous agents learning from their own signals and interactive learning
agents fully taught by their teachers. In between should stand teachable
autotelic agents (TAA): agents that learn from both internal and teaching
signals to benefit from the higher efficiency of assisted discovery. Designing
such agents will enable real-world non-expert users to orient the learning
trajectories of agents towards their expectations. More fundamentally, this may
also be a key step to build agents with human-level intelligence. This paper
presents a roadmap towards the design of teachable autonomous agents. Building
on developmental psychology and education sciences, we start by identifying key
features enabling assisted discovery processes in child-tutor interactions.
This leads to the production of a checklist of features that future TAA will
need to demonstrate. The checklist allows us to precisely pinpoint the various
limitations of current reinforcement learning agents and to identify the
promising first steps towards TAA. It also shows the way forward by
highlighting key research directions towards the design or autonomous agents
that can be taught by ordinary people via natural pedagogy.",2021-05-25,2021,2021-05,education

"Teaching Machine Learning in K-12 Computing Education: Potential and
  Pitfalls","Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning
techniques have shown the potential of data-driven approaches in a large number
of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing
curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are
expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12
computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of
such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and
teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational
thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula,
understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an
even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the
central position of machine learning in the field of modern computing, the
computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies
of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning
systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article
charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and
technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article
situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general,
and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into
account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the
paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine
learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is
abandoning the belief that rule-based ""traditional"" programming is a central

Towards Fairness Certification in Artificial Intelligence,"Thanks to the great progress of machine learning in the last years, several
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been increasingly moving from the
controlled research laboratory settings to our everyday life. AI is clearly
supportive in many decision-making scenarios, but when it comes to sensitive
areas such as health care, hiring policies, education, banking or justice, with
major impact on individuals and society, it becomes crucial to establish
guidelines on how to design, develop, deploy and monitor this technology.
Indeed the decision rules elaborated by machine learning models are data-driven
and there are multiple ways in which discriminatory biases can seep into data.
Algorithms trained on those data incur the risk of amplifying prejudices and
societal stereotypes by over associating protected attributes such as gender,
ethnicity or disabilities with the prediction task. Starting from the extensive
experience of the National Metrology Institute on measurement standards and
certification roadmaps, and of Politecnico di Torino on machine learning as
well as methods for domain bias evaluation and mastering, we propose a first
joint effort to define the operational steps needed for AI fairness
certification. Specifically we will overview the criteria that should be met by
an AI system before coming into official service and the conformity assessment
procedures useful to monitor its functioning for fair decisions.",2021-06-04,2021,2021-06,education

question generation as a controllable sequence generation task. We first show
how to fine-tune pre-trained language models for deep knowledge tracing
(LM-KT). This model accurately predicts the probability of a student answering
a question correctly, and generalizes to questions not seen in training. We

interests. These different perspectives are often not understood, due in part
to communication gaps.For example, AI researchers who design and develop AI
models are not necessarily aware of the instability induced in consumers' lives

"Automatic Task Requirements Writing Evaluation via Machine Reading
  Comprehension","Task requirements (TRs) writing is an important question type in Key English
Test and Preliminary English Test. A TR writing question may include multiple

"Readying Medical Students for Medical AI: The Need to Embed AI Ethics
  Education","Medical students will almost inevitably encounter powerful medical AI systems
early in their careers. Yet, contemporary medical education does not adequately

Unlike other calls for education reform to accommodate AI teaching that are
more radical in scope, our framework is modest and incremental. It leverages
existing bioethics or medical ethics curricula to develop and deliver content
on the ethical issues associated with medical AI, especially the harms of
technology misuse, disuse, and abuse that affect the risk-benefit analyses at
the heart of healthcare. In doing so, the framework provides a simple tool for

Learning (MSNF-MTCL) to predict 5 important students' retention risks: future
dropout, next semester dropout, type of dropout, duration of dropout and cause
of dropout. First, we develop a general purpose multi-modal neural fusion
network model MSNF for learning students' academic information representation
by fusing spatial and temporal unstructured advising notes with spatiotemporal
structured data. MSNF combines a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT)-based document embedding framework to represent each
advising note, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to model temporal advising
note embeddings, LSTM network to model students' temporal performance variables
and students' static demographics altogether. The final fused representation
from MSNF has been utilized on a Multi-Task Cascade Learning (MTCL) model
towards building MSNF-MTCL for predicting 5 student retention risks. We
evaluate MSNFMTCL on a large educational database consists of 36,445 college
students over 18 years period of time that provides promising performances
comparing with the nearest state-of-art models. Additionally, we test the
fairness of such model given the existence of biases.",2021-09-11,2021,2021-09,education

"Some Critical and Ethical Perspectives on the Empirical Turn of AI
  Interpretability","We consider two fundamental and related issues currently faced by Artificial
Intelligence (AI) development: the lack of ethics and interpretability of AI
decisions. Can interpretable AI decisions help to address ethics in AI? Using a
randomized study, we experimentally show that the empirical and liberal turn of
the production of explanations tends to select AI explanations with a low
denunciatory power. Under certain conditions, interpretability tools are
therefore not means but, paradoxically, obstacles to the production of ethical
AI since they can give the illusion of being sensitive to ethical incidents. We
also show that the denunciatory power of AI explanations is highly dependent on
the context in which the explanation takes place, such as the gender or
education level of the person to whom the explication is intended for. AI
ethics tools are therefore sometimes too flexible and self-regulation through
the liberal production of explanations do not seem to be enough to address
ethical issues. We then propose two scenarios for the future development of
ethical AI: more external regulation or more liberalization of AI explanations.
These two opposite paths will play a major role on the future development of
ethical AI.",2021-09-20,2021,2021-09,education
"Artificial intelligence for Sustainable Energy: A Contextual Topic
  Modeling and Content Analysis","Parallel to the rising debates over sustainable energy and artificial
intelligence solutions, the world is currently discussing the ethics of
artificial intelligence and its possible negative effects on society and the
environment. In these arguments, sustainable AI is proposed, which aims at
advancing the pathway toward sustainability, such as sustainable energy. In
this paper, we offered a novel contextual topic modeling combining LDA, BERT,
and Clustering. We then combined these computational analyses with content
analysis of related scientific publications to identify the main scholarly
topics, sub-themes, and cross-topic themes within scientific research on
sustainable AI in energy. Our research identified eight dominant topics
including sustainable buildings, AI-based DSSs for urban water management,
climate artificial intelligence, Agriculture 4, the convergence of AI with IoT,
AI-based evaluation of renewable technologies, smart campus and engineering
education, and AI-based optimization. We then recommended 14 potential future
research strands based on the observed theoretical gaps. Theoretically, this

from a systematic understanding of the competencies underlying AI expertise. In
this paper, we observe that AI expertise requires integrating computational,

``AI triplet,'' similar in spirit to the ``chemistry triplet'' that has heavily
influenced the past four decades of chemistry education research. We describe a
theoretical foundation for this triplet and show how it maps onto two sample AI
topics: tree search and gradient descent. Finally, just as the chemistry
triplet has impacted chemistry education in concrete ways, we suggest two
initial hypotheses for how the AI triplet might impact AI education: 1) how we
can help AI students gain proficiency in moving between the corners of the

"Explainable Student Performance Prediction With Personalized Attention
  for Explaining Why A Student Fails","As student failure rates continue to increase in higher education, predicting
student performance in the following semester has become a significant demand.
Personalized student performance prediction helps educators gain a
comprehensive view of student status and effectively intervene in advance.
However, existing works scarcely consider the explainability of student
performance prediction, which educators are most concerned about. In this
paper, we propose a novel Explainable Student performance prediction method
with Personalized Attention (ESPA) by utilizing relationships in student
profiles and prior knowledge of related courses. The designed Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture extracts the semantic information
in the paths with specific patterns. As for leveraging similar paths' internal
relations, a local and global-level attention mechanism is proposed to
distinguish the influence of different students or courses for making
predictions. Hence, valid reasoning on paths can be applied to predict the
performance of students. The ESPA consistently outperforms the other
state-of-the-art models for student performance prediction, and the results are
intuitively explainable. This work can help educators better understand the
different impacts of behavior on students' studies.",2021-10-15,2021,2021-10,education
Risks of AI Foundation Models in Education,"If the authors of a recent Stanford report (Bommasani et al., 2021) on the
opportunities and risks of ""foundation models"" are to be believed, these models
represent a paradigm shift for AI and for the domains in which they will
supposedly be used, including education. Although the name is new (and
contested (Field, 2021)), the term describes existing types of algorithmic
models that are ""trained on broad data at scale"" and ""fine-tuned"" (i.e.,
adapted) for particular downstream tasks, and is intended to encompass large
language models such as BERT or GPT-3 and computer vision models such as CLIP.
Such technologies have the potential for harm broadly speaking (e.g., Bender et
al., 2021), but their use in the educational domain is particularly fraught,
despite the potential benefits for learners claimed by the authors. In section
3.3 of the Stanford report, Malik et al. argue that achieving the goal of
providing education for all learners requires more efficient computational
approaches that can rapidly scale across educational domains and across
educational contexts, for which they argue foundation models are uniquely
well-suited. However, evidence suggests that not only are foundation models not
likely to achieve the stated benefits for learners, but their use may also
introduce new risks for harm.",2021-10-19,2021,2021-10,education
"Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Smart City Application: A Secure
  and Trusted Platform","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the disruptive technologies that is
shaping the future. It has growing applications for data-driven decisions in
major smart city solutions, including transportation, education, healthcare,
public governance, and power systems. At the same time, it is gaining
popularity in protecting critical cyber infrastructure from cyber threats,
attacks, damages, or unauthorized access. However, one of the significant
issues of those traditional AI technologies (e.g., deep learning) is that the
rapid progress in complexity and sophistication propelled and turned out to be
uninterpretable black boxes. On many occasions, it is very challenging to
understand the decision and bias to control and trust systems' unexpected or
seemingly unpredictable outputs. It is acknowledged that the loss of control
over interpretability of decision-making becomes a critical issue for many
data-driven automated applications. But how may it affect the system's security
and trustworthiness? This chapter conducts a comprehensive study of machine
learning applications in cybersecurity to indicate the need for explainability
to address this question. While doing that, this chapter first discusses the
black-box problems of AI technologies for Cybersecurity applications in smart
city-based solutions. Later, considering the new technological paradigm,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), this chapter discusses the
transition from black-box to white-box. This chapter also discusses the

"An AI-based Solution for Enhancing Delivery of Digital Learning for

are provided the ability to modify/edit any AI generated questions. This
approach encourages trust and engagement of teachers in the use and

Introducing Variational Autoencoders to High School Students,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are a compelling way to
introduce K-12 students to AI education using an artistic medium, and hence
have drawn attention from K-12 AI educators. Previous Creative AI curricula
mainly focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) while paying less
attention to Autoregressive Models, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or other
generative models, which have since become common in the field of generative
AI. VAEs' latent-space structure and interpolation ability could effectively
ground the interdisciplinary learning of AI, creative arts, and philosophy.
Thus, we designed a lesson to teach high school students about VAEs. We
developed a web-based game and used Plato's cave, a philosophical metaphor, to
introduce how VAEs work. We used a Google Colab notebook for students to
re-train VAEs with their hand-written digits to consolidate their
understandings. Finally, we guided the exploration of creative VAE tools such
as SketchRNN and MusicVAE to draw the connection between what they learned and
real-world applications. This paper describes the lesson design and shares

"Words of Wisdom: Representational Harms in Learning From AI
  Communication","Many educational technologies use artificial intelligence (AI) that presents
generated or produced language to the learner. We contend that all language,
including all AI communication, encodes information about the identity of the
human or humans who contributed to crafting the language. With AI
communication, however, the user may index identity information that does not
match the source. This can lead to representational harms if language
associated with one cultural group is presented as ""standard"" or ""neutral"", if
the language advantages one group over another, or if the language reinforces
negative stereotypes. In this work, we discuss a case study using a Visual
Question Generation (VQG) task involving gathering crowdsourced data from
targeted demographic groups. Generated questions will be presented to human
evaluators to understand how they index the identity behind the language,
whether and how they perceive any representational harms, and how they would
ideally address any such harms caused by AI communication. We reflect on the

"Interpretable Knowledge Tracing: Simple and Efficient Student Modeling
  with Causal Relations","Intelligent Tutoring Systems have become critically important in future
learning environments. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a crucial part of that system.
It is about inferring the skill mastery of students and predicting their
performance to adjust the curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning-based KT models
have shown significant predictive performance compared with traditional models.
However, it is difficult to extract psychologically meaningful explanations
from the tens of thousands of parameters in neural networks, that would relate
to cognitive theory. There are several ways to achieve high accuracy in student
performance prediction but diagnostic and prognostic reasoning is more critical
in learning sciences. Since KT problem has few observable features (problem ID
and student's correctness at each practice), we extract meaningful latent
features from students' response data by using machine learning and data mining
techniques. In this work, we present Interpretable Knowledge Tracing (IKT), a
simple model that relies on three meaningful latent features: individual skill
mastery, ability profile (learning transfer across skills), and problem
difficulty. IKT's prediction of future student performance is made using a
Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier (TAN), therefore its predictions are
easier to explain than deep learning-based student models. IKT also shows
better student performance prediction than deep learning-based student models
without requiring a huge amount of parameters. We conduct ablation studies on
each feature to examine their contribution to student performance prediction.

disappointments that have followed.
  The purpose of this book is to give a realistic picture of AI, its history,
its potential and limitations. We believe that AI is a helper, not a ruler of
humans. We begin by describing what AI is and how it has evolved over the
decades. After fundamentals, we explain the importance of massive data for the
current mainstream of artificial intelligence. The most common representations
for AI, methods, and machine learning are covered. In addition, the main
application areas are introduced. Computer vision has been central to the
development of AI. The book provides a general introduction to computer vision,
and includes an exposure to the results and applications of our own research.
Emotions are central to human intelligence, but little use has been made in AI.
We present the basics of emotional intelligence and our own research on the
topic. We discuss super-intelligence that transcends human understanding,
explaining why such achievement seems impossible on the basis of present

  Application in Leading Paragraph Generation","Effective human learning depends on a wide selection of educational materials
that align with the learner's current understanding of the topic. While the
Internet has revolutionized human learning or education, a substantial resource
accessibility barrier still exists. Namely, the excess of online information
can make it challenging to navigate and discover high-quality learning
materials. In this paper, we propose the educational resource discovery (ERD)
pipeline that automates web resource discovery for novel domains. The pipeline
consists of three main steps: data collection, feature extraction, and resource
classification. We start with a known source domain and conduct resource
discovery on two unseen target domains via transfer learning. We first collect
frequent queries from a set of seed documents and search on the web to obtain
candidate resources, such as lecture slides and introductory blog posts. Then
we introduce a novel pretrained information retrieval deep neural network
model, query-document masked language modeling (QD-MLM), to extract deep
features of these candidate resources. We apply a tree-based classifier to
decide whether the candidate is a positive learning resource. The pipeline
achieves F1 scores of 0.94 and 0.82 when evaluated on two similar but novel
target domains. Finally, we demonstrate how this pipeline can benefit an
application: leading paragraph generation for surveys. This is the first study
that considers various web resources for survey generation, to the best of our
knowledge. We also release a corpus of 39,728 manually labeled web resources
and 659 queries from NLP, Computer Vision (CV), and Statistics (STATS).",2022-01-07,2022,2022-01,education
"A conceptual framework of Intelligent Management Control System for
  Higher Education","The utilization of management control systems in university management poses
a considerable challenge because university's strategic goals are not identical
to those applied in profit-oriented management. A university's management
control system should take into account the processing of management
information for management purposes, allowing for the relationships between
different groups of stakeholders. The specificity of the university operation
assumes conducting long-term scientific research and educational programmes.
Therefore, the controlling approach to university management should considerat
long-term performance measurement as well as management in key areas such as
research, provision of education to students, and interaction with the tertiary
institution's socioeconomic environment.This paper aims to develop a conceptual
framework of the Intelligent Management Control System for Higher Education

Revelation of Task Difficulty in AI-aided Education,"When a student is asked to perform a given task, her subjective estimate of
the difficulty of that task has a strong influence on her performance. There
exists a rich literature on the impact of perceived task difficulty on
performance and motivation. Yet, there is another topic that is closely related
to the subject of the influence of perceived task difficulty that did not
receive any attention in previous research - the influence of revealing the
true difficulty of a task to the student. This paper investigates the impact of
revealing the task difficulty on the student's performance, motivation,
self-efficacy and subjective task value via an experiment in which workers are
asked to solve matchstick riddles. Furthermore, we discuss how the experiment
results might be relevant for AI-aided education. Specifically, we elaborate on
the question of how a student's learning experience might be improved by
supporting her with two types of AI systems: an AI system that predicts task
difficulty and an AI system that determines when task difficulty should be
revealed and when not.",2022-01-12,2022,2022-01,education

Fooling MOSS Detection with Pretrained Language Models,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly powerful and
prominent in society, their misuse is a growing concern. In educational
settings, AI technologies could be used by students to cheat on assignments and
exams. In this paper we explore whether transformers can be used to solve
introductory level programming assignments while bypassing commonly used AI
tools to detect similarities between pieces of software. We find that a student
using GPT-J [Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021] can complete introductory level
programming assignments without triggering suspicion from MOSS [Aiken, 2000], a
widely used software similarity and plagiarism detection tool. This holds
despite the fact that GPT-J was not trained on the problems in question and is
not provided with any examples to work from. We further find that the code
written by GPT-J is diverse in structure, lacking any particular tells that
future plagiarism detection techniques may use to try to identify
algorithmically generated code. We conclude with a discussion of the ethical

Surf or sleep? Understanding the influence of bedtime patterns on campus,"Poor sleep habits may cause serious problems of mind and body, and it is a
commonly observed issue for college students due to study workload as well as
peer and social influence. Understanding its impact and identifying students
with poor sleep habits matters a lot in educational management. Most of the
current research is either based on self-reports and questionnaires, suffering
from a small sample size and social desirability bias, or the methods used are
not suitable for the education system. In this paper, we develop a general
data-driven method for identifying students' sleep patterns according to their
Internet access pattern stored in the education management system and explore
its influence from various aspects. First, we design a Possion-based
probabilistic mixture model to cluster students according to the distribution
of bedtime and identify students who are used to staying up late. Second, we
profile students from five aspects (including eight dimensions) based on
campus-behavior data and build Bayesian networks to explore the relationship
between behavioral characteristics and sleeping habits. Finally, we test the

"Improving Students' Academic Performance with AI and Semantic
  Technologies","Artificial intelligence and semantic technologies are evolving and have been
applied in various research areas, including the education domain. Higher
Education institutions strive to improve students' academic performance. Early
intervention to at-risk students and a reasonable curriculum is vital for
students' success. Prior research opted for deploying traditional machine
learning models to predict students' performance. In terms of curriculum
semantic analysis, after conducting a comprehensive systematic review regarding
the use of semantic technologies in the Computer Science curriculum, a major
finding of the study is that technologies used to measure similarity have
limitations in terms of accuracy and ambiguity in the representation of
concepts, courses, etc. To fill these gaps, in this study, three
implementations were developed, that is, to predict students' performance using
marks from the previous semester, to model a course representation in a
semantic way and compute the similarity, and to identify the prerequisite
between two similar courses. Regarding performance prediction, we used the
combination of Genetic Algorithm and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) on a dataset
from a Brazilian university containing 248730 records. As for similarity
measurement, we deployed BERT to encode the sentences and used cosine
similarity to obtain the distance between courses. With respect to prerequisite
identification, TextRazor was applied to extract concepts from course
description, followed by employing SemRefD to measure the degree of
prerequisite between two concepts. The outcomes of this study can be summarized
as: (i) a breakthrough result improves Manrique's work by 2.5% in terms of
accuracy in dropout prediction; (ii) uncover the similarity between courses

educational dialogue? Designing an AI teacher test is challenging: although
evaluation methods are much-needed, there is no off-the-shelf solution to

conversational agents in parallel to human teachers in real-world dialogues,
simulate how different agents would respond to a student, and compare these
counterpart responses in terms of three abilities: speak like a teacher,
understand a student, help a student. Our method builds on the reliability of
comparative judgments in education and uses a probabilistic model and Bayesian
sampling to infer estimates of pedagogical ability. We find that, even though
conversational agents (Blender in particular) perform well on conversational
uptake, they are quantifiably worse than real teachers on several pedagogical
dimensions, especially with regard to helpfulness (Blender: {\Delta} ability =
-0.75; GPT-3: {\Delta} ability = -0.93).",2022-05-16,2022,2022-05,education

"Human-AI communication for human-human communication: Applying
  interpretable unsupervised anomaly detection to executive coaching","In this paper, we discuss the potential of applying unsupervised anomaly
detection in constructing AI-based interactive systems that deal with highly
contextual situations, i.e., human-human communication, in collaboration with
domain experts. We reached this approach of utilizing unsupervised anomaly
detection through our experience of developing a computational support tool for
executive coaching, which taught us the importance of providing interpretable
results so that expert coaches can take both the results and contexts into
account. The key idea behind this approach is to leave room for expert coaches
to unleash their open-ended interpretations, rather than simplifying the nature
of social interactions to well-defined problems that are tractable by
conventional supervised algorithms. In addition, we found that this approach
can be extended to nurturing novice coaches; by prompting them to interpret the
results from the system, it can provide the coaches with educational
opportunities. Although the applicability of this approach should be validated
in other domains, we believe that the idea of leveraging unsupervised anomaly
detection to construct AI-based interactive systems would shed light on another

their design considers fairness at every step. Through anonymous surveys and
interviews with experts (researchers and practitioners) who have published
their research at top-tier educational conferences in the last year, we
conducted the first expert-driven systematic investigation on the challenges

"DialogID: A Dialogic Instruction Dataset for Improving Teaching
  Effectiveness in Online Environments","Online dialogic instructions are a set of pedagogical instructions used in
real-world online educational contexts to motivate students, help understand
learning materials, and build effective study habits. In spite of the
popularity and advantages of online learning, the education technology and
educational data mining communities still suffer from the lack of large-scale,
high-quality, and well-annotated teaching instruction datasets to study
computational approaches to automatically detect online dialogic instructions
and further improve the online teaching effectiveness. Therefore, in this
paper, we present a dataset of online dialogic instruction detection,
\textsc{DialogID}, which contains 30,431 effective dialogic instructions. These
teaching instructions are well annotated into 8 categories. Furthermore, we
utilize the prevalent pre-trained language models (PLMs) and propose a simple
yet effective adversarial training learning paradigm to improve the quality and
generalization of dialogic instruction detection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms a wide range of baseline methods. The

Implementing a Chatbot Solution for Learning Management System,"Innovation is a key component in trying new solutions for the students to
learn efficiently and in ways that correspond to their own experience, where
chatbots are one of these new solutions. One of the main problem that chatbots
face today is to mimic human language, where they try to find the best answer
to an input, which is not how a human conversation usually works, rather taking
into account the previous messages and building onto them. Extreme programming
methodology was chosen to use integrate ChatterBot, Pyside2, web scraping and
Tampermonkey into Blackboard as a test case. Problems occurred with the bot and
more training was needed for the bot to work perfectly, but the integration and
web scraping worked, giving us a chatbot that was able to talk with. We showed
the plausibility of integrating an AI bot in an educational setting.",2022-06-27,2022,2022-06,education
"Kwame for Science: An AI Teaching Assistant Based on Sentence-BERT for
  Science Education in West Africa","Africa has a high student-to-teacher ratio which limits students' access to
teachers. Consequently, students struggle to get answers to their questions. In
this work, we extended Kwame, our previous AI teaching assistant, adapted it
for science education, and deployed it as a web app. Kwame for Science answers
questions of students based on the Integrated Science subject of the West
African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE). Kwame for Science is
a Sentence-BERT-based question-answering web app that displays 3 paragraphs as
answers along with a confidence score in response to science questions.
Additionally, it displays the top 5 related past exam questions and their
answers in addition to the 3 paragraphs. Our preliminary evaluation of the
Kwame for Science with a 2.5-week real-world deployment showed a top 3 accuracy
of 87.5% (n=56) with 190 users across 11 countries. Kwame for Science will

"Complementary artificial intelligence designed to augment human
  discovery","Neither artificial intelligence designed to play Turing's imitation game, nor
augmented intelligence built to maximize the human manipulation of information
are tuned to accelerate innovation and improve humanity's collective advance
against its greatest challenges. We reconceptualize and pilot beneficial AI to
radically augment human understanding by complementing rather than competing
with human cognitive capacity. Our approach to complementary intelligence
builds on insights underlying the wisdom of crowds, which hinges on the
independence and diversity of crowd members' information and approach. By
programmatically incorporating information on the evolving distribution of
scientific expertise from research papers, our approach follows the
distribution of content in the literature while avoiding the scientific crowd
and the hypotheses cognitively available to it. We use this approach to
generate valuable predictions for what materials possess valuable
energy-related properties (e.g., thermoelectricity), and what compounds possess
valuable medical properties (e.g., asthma) that complement the human scientific
crowd. We demonstrate that our complementary predictions, if identified by
human scientists and inventors at all, are only discovered years further into
the future. When we evaluate the promise of our predictions with
first-principles equations, we demonstrate that increased complementarity of
our predictions does not decrease and in some cases increases the probability
that the predictions possess the targeted properties. In summary, by tuning AI
to avoid the crowd, we can generate hypotheses unlikely to be imagined or
pursued until the distant future and promise to punctuate scientific advance.
By identifying and correcting for collective human bias, these models also
suggest opportunities to improve human prediction by reformulating science

Reflections on the Evolution of Computer Science Education,"Computer Science education has been evolving over the years to reflect
applied realities. Until about a decade ago, theory of computation, algorithm
design and system software dominated the curricula. Most courses were
considered core and were hence mandatory; the programme structure did not allow
much of a choice or variety. This column analyses why this changed Circa 2010
when elective subjects across scores of topics become part of mainstream
education to reflect the on-going lateral acceleration of Computer Science.
Fundamental discoveries in artificial intelligence, machine learning,
virtualization and cloud computing are several decades old. Many core theories
in data science are centuries old. Yet their leverage exploded only after Circa
2010, when the stage got set for people-centric problem solving in massive
scale. This was due in part to the rush of innovative real-world applications
that reached the common man through the ubiquitous smart phone. AI/ML modules
arrived in popular programming languages; they could be used to build and train
models on powerful - yet affordable - compute on public clouds reachable
through high-speed Internet connectivity. Academia responded by adapting
Computer Science curricula to align it with the changing technology landscape.
The goal of this experiential piece is to trigger a lively discussion on the
past and future of Computer Science education.",2022-07-09,2022,2022-07,education

Using Adaptive Experiments to Rapidly Help Students,"Adaptive experiments can increase the chance that current students obtain
better outcomes from a field experiment of an instructional intervention. In
such experiments, the probability of assigning students to conditions changes
while more data is being collected, so students can be assigned to
interventions that are likely to perform better. Digital educational
environments lower the barrier to conducting such adaptive experiments, but
they are rarely applied in education. One reason might be that researchers have
access to few real-world case studies that illustrate the advantages and
disadvantages of these experiments in a specific context. We evaluate the
effect of homework email reminders in students by conducting an adaptive
experiment using the Thompson Sampling algorithm and compare it to a
traditional uniform random experiment. We present this as a case study on how
to conduct such experiments, and we raise a range of open questions about the

"Multimodal Lecture Presentations Dataset: Understanding Multimodality in

figures accompanied by speech, are constructed and presented carefully in order
to optimally transfer knowledge to students. Previous studies in multimedia and
psychology attribute the effectiveness of lecture presentations to their
multimodal nature. As a step toward developing AI to aid in student learning as
intelligent teacher assistants, we introduce the Multimodal Lecture
Presentations dataset as a large-scale benchmark testing the capabilities of
machine learning models in multimodal understanding of educational content. Our
dataset contains aligned slides and spoken language, for 180+ hours of video
and 9000+ slides, with 10 lecturers from various subjects (e.g., computer
science, dentistry, biology). We introduce two research tasks which are
designed as stepping stones towards AI agents that can explain (automatically
captioning a lecture presentation) and illustrate (synthesizing visual figures
to accompany spoken explanations) educational content. We provide manual
annotations to help implement these two research tasks and evaluate
state-of-the-art models on them. Comparing baselines and human student
performances, we find that current models struggle in (1) weak crossmodal
alignment between slides and spoken text, (2) learning novel visual mediums,
(3) technical language, and (4) long-range sequences. Towards addressing this
issue, we also introduce PolyViLT, a multimodal transformer trained with a
multi-instance learning loss that is more effective than current approaches. We
conclude by shedding light on the challenges and opportunities in multimodal
understanding of educational presentations.",2022-08-17,2022,2022-08,education

"Why Are Some Online Educational Programs Successful? Student Cognition

interaction, and have low student engagement and retention. Thus, alternative
programs for online education have emerged including an online graduate program
in computer science at a major public university in USA. This program is
considered a success with over 9000 students now enrolled in the program. We
adopt the perspective of cognitive science to answer the question why do only
some online educational courses succeed? We measure learner motivation and
self-regulation in one course in the program, specifically a course on
artificial intelligence (AI). Surveys of students indicate that students
self-reported assessments of self-efficacy, cognitive strategy use, and
intrinsic value of the course are not only fairly high, but also generally
increase over the course of learning. This data suggests that the online AI

"Lost in Translation: Reimagining the Machine Learning Life Cycle in

novel uses, there is a pressing need to investigate how ML techniques support
long-standing education principles and goals. In this work, we shed light on
this complex landscape drawing on qualitative insights from interviews with
education experts. These interviews comprise in-depth evaluations of ML for
education (ML4Ed) papers published in preeminent applied ML conferences over
the past decade. Our central research goal is to critically examine how the
stated or implied education and societal objectives of these papers are aligned
with the ML problems they tackle. That is, to what extent does the technical
problem formulation, objectives, approach, and interpretation of results align
with the education problem at hand. We find that a cross-disciplinary gap
exists and is particularly salient in two parts of the ML life cycle: the
formulation of an ML problem from education goals and the translation of
predictions to interventions. We use these insights to propose an extended ML
life cycle, which may also apply to the use of ML in other domains. Our work
joins a growing number of meta-analytical studies across education and ML
research, as well as critical analyses of the societal impact of ML.

"A Framework for Undergraduate Data Collection Strategies for Student
  Support Recommendation Systems in Higher Education","Understanding which student support strategies mitigate dropout and improve
student retention is an important part of modern higher educational research.
One of the largest challenges institutions of higher learning currently face is
the scalability of student support. Part of this is due to the shortage of
staff addressing the needs of students, and the subsequent referral pathways
associated to provide timeous student support strategies. This is further
complicated by the difficulty of these referrals, especially as students are
often faced with a combination of administrative, academic, social, and
socio-economic challenges. A possible solution to this problem can be a
combination of student outcome predictions and applying algorithmic recommender
systems within the context of higher education. While much effort and detail
has gone into the expansion of explaining algorithmic decision making in this
context, there is still a need to develop data collection strategies Therefore,
the purpose of this paper is to outline a data collection framework specific to
recommender systems within this context in order to reduce collection biases,
understand student characteristics, and find an ideal way to infer optimal
influences on the student journey. If confirmation biases, challenges in data
sparsity and the type of information to collect from students are not

Reinforcement Learning in Education: A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach,"Advances in reinforcement learning research have demonstrated the ways in
which different agent-based models can learn how to optimally perform a task
within a given environment. Reinforcement leaning solves unsupervised problems
where agents move through a state-action-reward loop to maximize the overall
reward for the agent, which in turn optimizes the solving of a specific problem
in a given environment. However, these algorithms are designed based on our
understanding of actions that should be taken in a real-world environment to
solve a specific problem. One such problem is the ability to identify,
recommend and execute an action within a system where the users are the
subject, such as in education. In recent years, the use of blended learning
approaches integrating face-to-face learning with online learning in the
education context, has in-creased. Additionally, online platforms used for
education require the automation of certain functions such as the
identification, recommendation or execution of actions that can benefit the
user, in this sense, the student or learner. As promising as these scientific
advances are, there is still a need to conduct research in a variety of
different areas to ensure the successful deployment of these agents within

the adoption process to minimize these risks (e.g., safety regulations), these
do not exclude the possibility of harm occurring, and if this happens, victims
should be able to seek compensation. Liability regimes will therefore play a
key role in ensuring basic protection for victims using or interacting with
these systems. However, the same characteristics that make AI systems
inherently risky, such as lack of causality, opacity, unpredictability or their
self and continuous learning capabilities, may lead to considerable
difficulties when it comes to proving causation. This paper presents three case
studies, as well as the methodology to reach them, that illustrate these
difficulties. Specifically, we address the cases of cleaning robots, delivery
drones and robots in education. The outcome of the proposed analysis suggests
the need to revise liability regimes to alleviate the burden of proof on
victims in cases involving AI technologies.",2022-11-03,2022,2022-11,education
"End-to-End Evaluation of a Spoken Dialogue System for Learning Basic
  Mathematics","The advances in language-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies
applied to build educational applications can present AI for social-good
opportunities with a broader positive impact. Across many disciplines,
enhancing the quality of mathematics education is crucial in building critical
thinking and problem-solving skills at younger ages. Conversational AI systems
have started maturing to a point where they could play a significant role in
helping students learn fundamental math concepts. This work presents a
task-oriented Spoken Dialogue System (SDS) built to support play-based learning
of basic math concepts for early childhood education. The system has been
evaluated via real-world deployments at school while the students are
practicing early math concepts with multimodal interactions. We discuss our
efforts to improve the SDS pipeline built for math learning, for which we
explore utilizing MathBERT representations for potential enhancement to the

Automatic Creativity Measurement in Scratch Programs Across Modalities,"Promoting creativity is considered an important goal of education, but
creativity is notoriously hard to measure.In this paper, we make the journey
fromdefining a formal measure of creativity that is efficientlycomputable to
applying the measure in a practical domain. The measure is general and relies
on coretheoretical concepts in creativity theory, namely fluency, flexibility,
and originality, integratingwith prior cognitive science literature. We adapted
the general measure for projects in the popular visual programming language
Scratch.We designed a machine learning model for predicting the creativity of
Scratch projects, trained and evaluated on human expert creativity assessments
in an extensive user study. Our results show that opinions about creativity in
Scratch varied widely across experts. The automatic creativity assessment
aligned with the assessment of the human experts more than the experts agreed
with each other. This is a first step in providing computational models for
measuring creativity that can be applied to educational technologies, and to
scale up the benefit of creativity education in schools.",2022-11-07,2022,2022-11,education
"Collaborative and AI-aided Exam Question Generation using Wikidata in

"Prioritizing Policies for Furthering Responsible Artificial Intelligence
  in the United States","Several policy options exist, or have been proposed, to further responsible
artificial intelligence (AI) development and deployment. Institutions,
including U.S. government agencies, states, professional societies, and private
and public sector businesses, are well positioned to implement these policies.
However, given limited resources, not all policies can or should be equally
prioritized. We define and review nine suggested policies for furthering
responsible AI, rank each policy on potential use and impact, and recommend
prioritization relative to each institution type. We find that pre-deployment
audits and assessments and post-deployment accountability are likely to have
the highest impact but also the highest barriers to adoption. We recommend that
U.S. government agencies and companies highly prioritize development of
pre-deployment audits and assessments, while the U.S. national legislature
should highly prioritize post-deployment accountability. We suggest that U.S.
government agencies and professional societies should highly prioritize
policies that support responsible AI research and that states should highly
prioritize support of responsible AI education. We propose that companies can
highly prioritize involving community stakeholders in development efforts and
supporting diversity in AI development. We advise lower levels of
prioritization across institutions for AI ethics statements and databases of AI

  Content for Artificial Intelligence","Background: The clinical documentation of cystoscopy includes visual and
textual materials. However, the secondary use of visual cystoscopic data for
educational and research purposes remains limited due to inefficient data
management in routine clinical practice. Methods: A conceptual framework was
designed to document cystoscopy in a standardized manner with three major
sections: data management, annotation management, and utilization management. A
Swiss-cheese model was proposed for quality control and root cause analyses. We
defined the infrastructure required to implement the framework with respect to
FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, re-usable) principles. We applied
two scenarios exemplifying data sharing for research and educational projects
to ensure the compliance with FAIR principles. Results: The framework was
successfully implemented while following FAIR principles. The cystoscopy atlas

"Monotonicity for AI ethics and society: An empirical study of the
  monotonic neural additive model in criminology, education, health care, and

essential for a better society. As the foundational axiom of social mechanisms,
fairness consists of multiple facets. Although the machine learning (ML)
community has focused on intersectionality as a matter of statistical parity,
especially in discrimination issues, an emerging body of literature addresses
another facet -- monotonicity. Based on domain expertise, monotonicity plays a
vital role in numerous fairness-related areas, where violations could misguide
human decisions and lead to disastrous consequences. In this paper, we first
systematically evaluate the significance of applying monotonic neural additive
models (MNAMs), which use a fairness-aware ML algorithm to enforce both
individual and pairwise monotonicity principles, for the fairness of AI ethics

axioms is essential in all areas of fairness, including criminology, education,
health care, and finance. Our research contributes to the interdisciplinary
research at the interface of AI ethics, explainable AI (XAI), and

"Matching Exemplar as Next Sentence Prediction (MeNSP): Zero-shot Prompt
  Learning for Automatic Scoring in Science Education","Developing models to automatically score students' written responses to
science problems is critical for science education. However, collecting and
labeling sufficient student responses for training models is time and
cost-consuming. Recent studies suggest that pre-trained language models can be
adapted to downstream tasks without fine-tuning with prompts. However, no
research has employed such a prompt approach in science education. As student
responses are presented with natural language, aligning the scoring procedure
as the next sentence prediction task using prompts can skip the costly
fine-tuning stage. In this study, we developed a zero-shot approach to
automatically score student responses via Matching Exemplars as Next Sentence
Prediction (MeNSP). This approach employs no training samples. We first apply
MeNSP in scoring three assessment tasks of scientific argumentation and found
machine-human scoring agreements, Cohen's Kappa ranges from 0.30 to 0.57, and
F1 score ranges from 0.54 to 0.81. To improve the performance, we extend our
research to the few-shots setting, either randomly selecting labeled student
responses or manually constructing responses to fine-tune the models. We find
that one task's performance is improved with more samples, Cohen's Kappa from
0.30 to 0.38, and F1 score from 0.54 to 0.59; for the two others, scoring
performance is not improved. We also find that randomly selected few-shots
perform better than the human expert-crafted approach. This study suggests that
MeNSP can yield referable automatic scoring for student responses while
significantly reducing the cost of model training. This method can benefit
low-stakes classroom assessment practices in science education. Future research
should further explore the applicability of the MeNSP in different types of
assessment tasks in science education and improve the model performance.",2023-01-20,2023,2023-01,education

"Generating High-Precision Feedback for Programming Syntax Errors using
  Large Language Models","Large language models (LLMs), such as Codex, hold great promise in enhancing
programming education by automatically generating feedback for students. We
investigate using LLMs to generate feedback for fixing syntax errors in Python
programs, a key scenario in introductory programming. More concretely, given a
student's buggy program, our goal is to generate feedback comprising a fixed
program along with a natural language explanation describing the errors/fixes,
inspired by how a human tutor would give feedback. While using LLMs is
promising, the critical challenge is to ensure high precision in the generated
feedback, which is imperative before deploying such technology in classrooms.
The main research question we study is: Can we develop LLMs-based feedback
generation techniques with a tunable precision parameter, giving educators
quality control over the feedback that students receive? To this end, we
introduce PyFiXV, our technique to generate high-precision feedback powered by
Codex. The key idea behind PyFiXV is to use a novel run-time validation
mechanism to decide whether the generated feedback is suitable for sharing with
the student; notably, this validation mechanism also provides a precision knob
to educators. We perform an extensive evaluation using two real-world datasets

"Context Matters: A Strategy to Pre-train Language Model for Science
  Education","This study aims at improving the performance of scoring student responses in
science education automatically. BERT-based language models have shown
significant superiority over traditional NLP models in various language-related
tasks. However, science writing of students, including argumentation and
explanation, is domain-specific. In addition, the language used by students is
different from the language in journals and Wikipedia, which are training
sources of BERT and its existing variants. All these suggest that a
domain-specific model pre-trained using science education data may improve
model performance. However, the ideal type of data to contextualize pre-trained
language model and improve the performance in automatically scoring student
written responses remains unclear. Therefore, we employ different data in this
study to contextualize both BERT and SciBERT models and compare their
performance on automatic scoring of assessment tasks for scientific
argumentation. We use three datasets to pre-train the model: 1) journal
articles in science education, 2) a large dataset of students' written
responses (sample size over 50,000), and 3) a small dataset of students'
written responses of scientific argumentation tasks. Our experimental results
show that in-domain training corpora constructed from science questions and
responses improve language model performance on a wide variety of downstream
tasks. Our study confirms the effectiveness of continual pre-training on
domain-specific data in the education domain and demonstrates a generalizable
strategy for automating science education tasks with high accuracy. We plan to
release our data and SciEdBERT models for public use and community engagement.",2023-01-27,2023,2023-01,education

Will ChatGPT get you caught? Rethinking of Plagiarism Detection,"The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its impact on
education has been a topic of growing concern in recent years. The new
generation AI systems such as chatbots have become more accessible on the
Internet and stronger in terms of capabilities. The use of chatbots,
particularly ChatGPT, for generating academic essays at schools and colleges
has sparked fears among scholars. This study aims to explore the originality of
contents produced by one of the most popular AI chatbots, ChatGPT. To this end,
two popular plagiarism detection tools were used to evaluate the originality of
50 essays generated by ChatGPT on various topics. Our results manifest that
ChatGPT has a great potential to generate sophisticated text outputs without
being well caught by the plagiarism check software. In other words, ChatGPT can
create content on many topics with high originality as if they were written by
someone. These findings align with the recent concerns about students using
chatbots for an easy shortcut to success with minimal or no effort. Moreover,
ChatGPT was asked to verify if the essays were generated by itself, as an
additional measure of plagiarism check, and it showed superior performance
compared to the traditional plagiarism-detection tools. The paper discusses the
need for institutions to consider appropriate measures to mitigate potential
plagiarism issues and advise on the ongoing debate surrounding the impact of AI
technology on education. Further implications are discussed in the paper.",2023-02-08,2023,2023-02,education
"A Human-Centered Review of Algorithms in Decision-Making in Higher
  Education","The use of algorithms for decision-making in higher education is steadily
growing, promising cost-savings to institutions and personalized service for
students but also raising ethical challenges around surveillance, fairness, and
interpretation of data. To address the lack of systematic understanding of how
these algorithms are currently designed, we reviewed an extensive corpus of
papers proposing algorithms for decision-making in higher education. We
categorized them based on input data, computational method, and target outcome,
and then investigated the interrelations of these factors with the application
of human-centered lenses: theoretical, participatory, or speculative design. We
found that the models are trending towards deep learning, and increased use of
student personal data and protected attributes, with the target scope expanding
towards automated decisions. However, despite the associated decrease in
interpretability and explainability, current development predominantly fails to
incorporate human-centered lenses. We discuss the challenges with these trends
and advocate for a human-centered approach.",2023-02-12,2023,2023-02,education
"Improving Interpretability of Deep Sequential Knowledge Tracing Models
  with Question-centric Cognitive Representations","Knowledge tracing (KT) is a crucial technique to predict students' future
performance by observing their historical learning processes. Due to the
powerful representation ability of deep neural networks, remarkable progress
has been made by using deep learning techniques to solve the KT problem. The
majority of existing approaches rely on the \emph{homogeneous question}
assumption that questions have equivalent contributions if they share the same
set of knowledge components. Unfortunately, this assumption is inaccurate in
real-world educational scenarios. Furthermore, it is very challenging to
interpret the prediction results from the existing deep learning based KT
models. Therefore, in this paper, we present QIKT, a question-centric
interpretable KT model to address the above challenges. The proposed QIKT
approach explicitly models students' knowledge state variations at a
fine-grained level with question-sensitive cognitive representations that are
jointly learned from a question-centric knowledge acquisition module and a
question-centric problem solving module. Meanwhile, the QIKT utilizes an item
response theory based prediction layer to generate interpretable prediction
results. The proposed QIKT model is evaluated on three public real-world
educational datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach is superior on
the KT prediction task, and it outperforms a wide range of deep learning based
KT models in terms of prediction accuracy with better model interpretability.

"Platform-Independent and Curriculum-Oriented Intelligent Assistant for
  Higher Education","Miscommunication and communication challenges between instructors and
students represents one of the primary barriers to post-secondary learning.
Students often avoid or miss opportunities to ask questions during office hours
due to insecurities or scheduling conflicts. Moreover, students need to work at
their own pace to have the freedom and time for the self-contemplation needed
to build conceptual understanding and develop creative thinking skills. To
eliminate barriers to student engagement, academic institutions need to
redefine their fundamental approach to education by proposing flexible
educational pathways that recognize continuous learning. To this end, we
developed an AI-augmented intelligent educational assistance framework based on
a power language model (i.e., GPT-3) that automatically generates
course-specific intelligent assistants regardless of discipline or academic
level. The virtual intelligent teaching assistant (TA) system will serve as a
voice-enabled helper capable of answering course-specific questions concerning
curriculum, logistics and course policies. It is envisioned to improve access
to course-related information for the students and reduce logistical workload
for the instructors and TAs. Its GPT-3-based knowledge discovery component as

"DKT-STDRL: Spatial and Temporal Representation Learning Enhanced Deep
  Knowledge Tracing for Learning Performance Prediction","Knowledge tracing (KT) serves as a primary part of intelligent education
systems. Most current KTs either rely on expert judgments or only exploit a
single network structure, which affects the full expression of learning
features. To adequately mine features of students' learning process, Deep
Knowledge Tracing Based on Spatial and Temporal Deep Representation Learning
for Learning Performance Prediction (DKT-STDRL) is proposed in this paper.
DKT-STDRL extracts spatial features from students' learning history sequence,
and then further extracts temporal features to extract deeper hidden
information. Specifically, firstly, the DKT-STDRL model uses CNN to extract the
spatial feature information of students' exercise sequences. Then, the spatial
features are connected with the original students' exercise features as joint
learning features. Then, the joint features are input into the BiLSTM part.
Finally, the BiLSTM part extracts the temporal features from the joint learning
features to obtain the prediction information of whether the students answer
correctly at the next time step. Experiments on the public education datasets
ASSISTment2009, ASSISTment2015, Synthetic-5, ASSISTchall, and Statics2011 prove

2022), July 31-August 12, 2022, Haifa, Israel ThEdu'22 was a vibrant workshop,
with two invited talk by Thierry Dana-Picard (Jerusalem College of Technology,
Jerusalem, Israel) and Yoni Zohar (Bar Ilan University, Tel Aviv, Israel) and
four contributions. An open call for papers was then issued, and attracted
seven submissions. Those submissions have been accepted by our reviewers, who
jointly produced at least three careful reports on each of the contributions.
The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. The
contributions in this volume are a faithful representation of the wide spectrum
of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused on the automated deduction research,
not losing track of the possible applications in an educational setting, to
those focused on the applications, in educational settings, of automated

Finding Similar Exercises in Retrieval Manner,"When students make a mistake in an exercise, they can consolidate it by
``similar exercises'' which have the same concepts, purposes and methods.
Commonly, for a certain subject and study stage, the size of the exercise bank
is in the range of millions to even tens of millions, how to find similar
exercises for a given exercise becomes a crucial technical problem. Generally,
we can assign a variety of explicit labels to the exercise, and then query
through the labels, but the label annotation is time-consuming, laborious and
costly, with limited precision and granularity, so it is not feasible. In
practice, we define ``similar exercises'' as a retrieval process of finding a
set of similar exercises based on recall, ranking and re-rank procedures,
called the \textbf{FSE} problem (Finding similar exercises). Furthermore,
comprehensive representation of the semantic information of exercises was
obtained through representation learning. In addition to the reasonable
architecture, we also explore what kind of tasks are more conducive to the
learning of exercise semantic information from pre-training and supervised
learning. It is difficult to annotate similar exercises and the annotation
consistency among experts is low. Therefore this paper also provides solutions
to solve the problem of low-quality annotated data. Compared with other
methods, this paper has obvious advantages in both architecture rationality and
algorithm precision, which now serves the daily teaching of hundreds of

"Practical and Ethical Challenges of Large Language Models in Education:
  A Systematic Scoping Review","Educational technology innovations leveraging large language models (LLMs)
have shown the potential to automate the laborious process of generating and

automate a range of educational tasks (e.g., question generation, feedback
provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality
and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research
and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts.
To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer-reviewed
papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using
LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use
cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main
categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support,
prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and
recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical
challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and
transparency, and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The
findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies,
including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
GPT-3/4), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and
adopting a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. As the

quantity of the selected samples and inform the extent to which a classifier
can learn patterns. Notably, the informativeness level may vary among the
samples and the classifier might only need a small amount of low informative
samples to learn the patterns. Random sampling may overlook sample
informativeness, which consumes human labelling costs and contributes less to
training the classifiers. As an alternative, researchers suggest employing
statistical sampling methods of Active Learning (AL) to identify the
informative samples for training the classifiers. However, the use of AL
methods in educational DA classification tasks is under-explored. In this
paper, we examine the informativeness of annotated sentence samples. Then, the
study investigates how the AL methods can select informative samples to support
DA classifiers in the AL sampling process. The results reveal that most
annotated sentences present low informativeness in the training dataset and the
patterns of these sentences can be easily captured by the DA classifier. We
also demonstrate how AL methods can reduce the cost of manual annotation in the
AL sampling process.",2023-04-12,2023,2023-04,education
"How do physics students evaluate artificial intelligence responses on
  comprehension questions? A study on the perceived scientific accuracy and
  linguistic quality","This study aimed at evaluating how students perceive the linguistic quality
and scientific accuracy of ChatGPT responses to physics comprehension
questions. A total of 102 first- and second-year physics students were
confronted with three questions of progressing difficulty from introductory
mechanics (rolling motion, waves, and fluid dynamics). Each question was
presented with four different responses. All responses were attributed to
ChatGPT, but in reality one sample solution was created by the researchers. All
ChatGPT responses obtained in this study were wrong, imprecise, incomplete, or
misleading. We found little differences in the perceived linguistic quality
between ChatGPT responses and the sample solution. However, the students rated
the overall scientific accuracy of the responses significantly differently,
with the sample solution being rated best for the questions of low and medium
difficulty. The discrepancy between the sample solution and the ChatGPT
responses increased with the level of self-assessed knowledge of the question
content. For the question of highest difficulty (fluid dynamics) that was
unknown to most students, a ChatGPT response was rated just as good as the
sample solution. Thus, this study provides data on the students' perception of
ChatGPT responses and the factors influencing their perception. The results
highlight the need for careful evaluation of ChatGPT responses both by
instructors and students, particularly regarding scientific accuracy.
Therefore, future research could explore the potential of similar ""spot the

"Robust Educational Dialogue Act Classifiers with Low-Resource and
  Imbalanced Datasets","Dialogue acts (DAs) can represent conversational actions of tutors or
students that take place during tutoring dialogues. Automating the
identification of DAs in tutoring dialogues is significant to the design of
dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems. Many prior studies employ machine
learning models to classify DAs in tutoring dialogues and invest much effort to
optimize the classification accuracy by using limited amounts of training data
(i.e., low-resource data scenario). However, beyond the classification
accuracy, the robustness of the classifier is also important, which can reflect
the capability of the classifier on learning the patterns from different class
distributions. We note that many prior studies on classifying educational DAs
employ cross entropy (CE) loss to optimize DA classifiers on low-resource data
with imbalanced DA distribution. The DA classifiers in these studies tend to
prioritize accuracy on the majority class at the expense of the minority class
which might not be robust to the data with imbalanced ratios of different DA
classes. To optimize the robustness of classifiers on imbalanced class
distributions, we propose to optimize the performance of the DA classifier by
maximizing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (i.e., AUC maximization).
Through extensive experiments, our study provides evidence that (i) by
maximizing AUC in the training process, the DA classifier achieves significant
performance improvement compared to the CE approach under low-resource data,
and (ii) AUC maximization approaches can improve the robustness of the DA
classifier under different class imbalance ratios.",2023-04-15,2023,2023-04,education

Learning (CALL). Recently, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into
CALL has brought about a significant shift in the traditional approach to
language education both inside and outside the classroom. In line with this
book's scope, I explore the advantages and disadvantages of AI-mediated
communication in language education. I begin with a brief review of AI in
education. I then introduce the ICALL and give a critical appraisal of the
potential of AI-powered automatic speech recognition (ASR), Machine Translation
(MT), Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), AI-powered chatbots, and Extended

overlap rates, which potentially affects test security. This paper introduces a
constrained version of BOBCAT to address these problems by changing its
optimization setup and enabling us to trade off test accuracy for question
exposure and test overlap rates. We show that C-BOBCAT is effective through
extensive experiments on two real-world adult testing datasets.",2023-05-18,2023,2023-05,education
"Leveraging Human Feedback to Scale Educational Datasets: Combining
  Crowdworkers and Comparative Judgement","Machine Learning models have many potentially beneficial applications in
education settings, but a key barrier to their development is securing enough
data to train these models. Labelling educational data has traditionally relied
on highly skilled raters using complex, multi-class rubrics, making the process
expensive and difficult to scale. An alternative, more scalable approach could
be to use non-expert crowdworkers to evaluate student work, however,
maintaining sufficiently high levels of accuracy and inter-rater reliability
when using non-expert workers is challenging. This paper reports on two
experiments investigating using non-expert crowdworkers and comparative
judgement to evaluate complex student data. Crowdworkers were hired to evaluate
student responses to open-ended reading comprehension questions. Crowdworkers
were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the control, where they were
asked to decide whether answers were correct or incorrect (i.e., a categorical
judgement), or the treatment, where they were shown the same question and
answers, but were instead asked to decide which of two candidate answers was
more correct (i.e., a comparative/preference-based judgement). We found that
using comparative judgement substantially improved inter-rater reliability on
both tasks. These results are in-line with well-established literature on the
benefits of comparative judgement in the field of educational assessment, as
well as with recent trends in artificial intelligence research, where
comparative judgement is becoming the preferred method for providing human
feedback on model outputs when working with non-expert crowdworkers. However,
to our knowledge, these results are novel and important in demonstrating the
beneficial effects of using the combination of comparative judgement and
crowdworkers to evaluate educational data.",2023-05-22,2023,2023-05,education

ChatGPT on modern education. This research seeks to improve our knowledge of
ChatGPT capabilities and its use in the education sector, identifying potential
concerns and challenges. Our preliminary evaluation concludes that ChatGPT
performed differently in each subject area including finance, coding and maths.
While ChatGPT has the ability to help educators by creating instructional
content, offering suggestions and acting as an online educator to learners by

use, such as the possibility of producing inaccurate or false data and
circumventing duplicate content (plagiarism) detectors where originality is
essential. The often reported hallucinations within Generative AI in general,
and also relevant for ChatGPT, can render its use of limited benefit where
accuracy is essential. What ChatGPT lacks is a stochastic measure to help
provide sincere and sensitive communication with its users. Academic
regulations and evaluation practices used in educational institutions need to
be updated, should ChatGPT be used as a tool in education. To address the
transformative effects of ChatGPT on the learning environment, educating
teachers and students alike about its capabilities and limitations will be
crucial.",2023-05-25,2023,2023-05,education

"The future of human-centric eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is

human understanding and trust in deep learning systems. As models get larger,
more ubiquitous, and pervasive in aspects of daily life, explainability is
necessary to minimize adverse effects of model mistakes. Unfortunately, current
approaches in human-centric XAI (e.g. predictive tasks in healthcare,

whereas recent work has identified systematic disagreement between post-hoc
explainers when applied to the same instances of underlying black-box models.
In this paper, we therefore present a call for action to address the

"Learning to Prompt in the Classroom to Understand AI Limits: A pilot
  study","Artificial intelligence's (AI) progress holds great promise in tackling
pressing societal concerns such as health and climate. Large Language Models
(LLM) and the derived chatbots, like ChatGPT, have highly improved the natural
language processing capabilities of AI systems allowing them to process an
unprecedented amount of unstructured data. However, the ensuing excitement has
led to negative sentiments, even as AI methods demonstrate remarkable
contributions (e.g. in health and genetics). A key factor contributing to this
sentiment is the misleading perception that LLMs can effortlessly provide
solutions across domains, ignoring their limitations such as hallucinations and
reasoning constraints. Acknowledging AI fallibility is crucial to address the
impact of dogmatic overconfidence in possibly erroneous suggestions generated
by LLMs. At the same time, it can reduce fear and other negative attitudes
toward AI. This necessitates comprehensive AI literacy interventions that
educate the public about LLM constraints and effective usage techniques, i.e
prompting strategies. With this aim, a pilot educational intervention was
performed in a high school with 21 students. It involved presenting high-level
concepts about intelligence, AI, and LLMs, followed by practical exercises
involving ChatGPT in creating natural educational conversations and applying
established prompting strategies. Encouraging preliminary results emerged,

"Generative Adversarial Networks for Dental Patient Identity Protection
  in Orthodontic Educational Imaging","Objectives: This research introduces a novel area-preserving Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) inversion technique for effectively de-identifying
dental patient images. This innovative method addresses privacy concerns while
preserving key dental features, thereby generating valuable resources for
dental education and research.
  Methods: We enhanced the existing GAN Inversion methodology to maximize the
preservation of dental characteristics within the synthesized images. A
comprehensive technical framework incorporating several deep learning models
was developed to provide end-to-end development guidance and practical
application for image de-identification.
  Results: Our approach was assessed with varied facial pictures, extensively
used for diagnosing skeletal asymmetry and facial anomalies. Results
demonstrated our model's ability to adapt the context from one image to
another, maintaining compatibility, while preserving dental features essential
for oral diagnosis and dental education. A panel of five clinicians conducted
an evaluation on a set of original and GAN-processed images. The generated
images achieved effective de-identification, maintaining the realism of
important dental features and were deemed useful for dental diagnostics and
education.
  Clinical Significance: Our GAN model and the encompassing framework can
streamline the de-identification process of dental patient images, enhancing
efficiency in dental education. This method improves students' diagnostic
capabilities by offering more exposure to orthodontic malocclusions.
Furthermore, it facilitates the creation of de-identified datasets for broader
2D image research at major research institutions.",2023-07-05,2023,2023-07,education
"Comparative Analysis of GPT-4 and Human Graders in Evaluating Praise
  Given to Students in Synthetic Dialogues","Research suggests that providing specific and timely feedback to human tutors
enhances their performance. However, it presents challenges due to the
time-consuming nature of assessing tutor performance by human evaluators. Large
language models, such as the AI-chatbot ChatGPT, hold potential for offering
constructive feedback to tutors in practical settings. Nevertheless, the
accuracy of AI-generated feedback remains uncertain, with scant research
investigating the ability of models like ChatGPT to deliver effective feedback.
In this work-in-progress, we evaluate 30 dialogues generated by GPT-4 in a
tutor-student setting. We use two different prompting approaches, the zero-shot
chain of thought and the few-shot chain of thought, to identify specific
components of effective praise based on five criteria. These approaches are
then compared to the results of human graders for accuracy. Our goal is to
assess the extent to which GPT-4 can accurately identify each praise criterion.
We found that both zero-shot and few-shot chain of thought approaches yield
comparable results. GPT-4 performs moderately well in identifying instances
when the tutor offers specific and immediate praise. However, GPT-4
underperforms in identifying the tutor's ability to deliver sincere praise,
particularly in the zero-shot prompting scenario where examples of sincere
tutor praise statements were not provided. Future work will focus on enhancing
prompt engineering, developing a more general tutoring rubric, and evaluating
our method using real-life tutoring dialogues.",2023-07-05,2023,2023-07,education
"It is not Sexually Suggestive, It is Educative. Separating Sex Education
  from Suggestive Content on TikTok Videos","We introduce SexTok, a multi-modal dataset composed of TikTok videos labeled
as sexually suggestive (from the annotator's point of view), sex-educational
content, or neither. Such a dataset is necessary to address the challenge of
distinguishing between sexually suggestive content and virtual sex education
videos on TikTok. Children's exposure to sexually suggestive videos has been
shown to have adversarial effects on their development. Meanwhile, virtual sex
education, especially on subjects that are more relevant to the LGBTQIA+
community, is very valuable. The platform's current system removes or penalizes
some of both types of videos, even though they serve different purposes. Our
dataset contains video URLs, and it is also audio transcribed. To validate its
importance, we explore two transformer-based models for classifying the videos.
Our preliminary results suggest that the task of distinguishing between these
types of videos is learnable but challenging. These experiments suggest that
this dataset is meaningful and invites further study on the subject.",2023-07-06,2023,2023-07,education
What Should Data Science Education Do with Large Language Models?,"The rapid advances of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are
revolutionizing data science and statistics. These state-of-the-art tools can
streamline complex processes. As a result, it reshapes the role of data
scientists. We argue that LLMs are transforming the responsibilities of data
scientists, shifting their focus from hands-on coding, data-wrangling and
conducting standard analyses to assessing and managing analyses performed by
these automated AIs. This evolution of roles is reminiscent of the transition
from a software engineer to a product manager. We illustrate this transition
with concrete data science case studies using LLMs in this paper. These
developments necessitate a meaningful evolution in data science education.
Pedagogy must now place greater emphasis on cultivating diverse skillsets among
students, such as LLM-informed creativity, critical thinking, AI-guided
programming. LLMs can also play a significant role in the classroom as
interactive teaching and learning tools, contributing to personalized
education. This paper discusses the opportunities, resources and open
challenges for each of these directions. As with any transformative technology,
integrating LLMs into education calls for careful consideration. While LLMs can
perform repetitive tasks efficiently, it's crucial to remember that their role
is to supplement human intelligence and creativity, not to replace it.
Therefore, the new era of data science education should balance the benefits of
LLMs while fostering complementary human expertise and innovations. In
conclusion, the rise of LLMs heralds a transformative period for data science
and its education. This paper seeks to shed light on the emerging trends,
potential opportunities, and challenges accompanying this paradigm shift,
hoping to spark further discourse and investigation into this exciting,
uncharted territory.",2023-07-06,2023,2023-07,education

"Balancing Privacy and Progress in Artificial Intelligence: Anonymization
  in Histopathology for Biomedical Research and Education","The advancement of biomedical research heavily relies on access to large
amounts of medical data. In the case of histopathology, Whole Slide Images
(WSI) and clinicopathological information are valuable for developing
Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Digital Pathology (DP).
Transferring medical data ""as open as possible"" enhances the usability of the
data for secondary purposes but poses a risk to patient privacy. At the same
time, existing regulations push towards keeping medical data ""as closed as
necessary"" to avoid re-identification risks. Generally, these legal regulations
require the removal of sensitive data but do not consider the possibility of
data linkage attacks due to modern image-matching algorithms. In addition, the
lack of standardization in DP makes it harder to establish a single solution
for all formats of WSIs. These challenges raise problems for bio-informatics
researchers in balancing privacy and progress while developing AI algorithms.
This paper explores the legal regulations and terminologies for medical
data-sharing. We review existing approaches and highlight challenges from the
histopathological perspective. We also present a data-sharing guideline for
histological data to foster multidisciplinary research and education.",2023-07-18,2023,2023-07,education
Amortised Design Optimization for Item Response Theory,"Item Response Theory (IRT) is a well known method for assessing responses
from humans in education and psychology. In education, IRT is used to infer
student abilities and characteristics of test items from student responses.
Interactions with students are expensive, calling for methods that efficiently
gather information for inferring student abilities. Methods based on Optimal
Experimental Design (OED) are computationally costly, making them inapplicable
for interactive applications. In response, we propose incorporating amortised
experimental design into IRT. Here, the computational cost is shifted to a
precomputing phase by training a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent with
synthetic data. The agent is trained to select optimally informative test items
for the distribution of students, and to conduct amortised inference
conditioned on the experiment outcomes. During deployment the agent estimates
parameters from data, and suggests the next test item for the student, in close
to real-time, by taking into account the history of experiments and outcomes.",2023-07-19,2023,2023-07,education

  Chatbots in Graduate Engineering Education","In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, digital technologies have
repeatedly disrupted traditional pedagogical methods. This paper explores the
latest of these disruptions: the potential integration of large language models
(LLMs) and chatbots into graduate engineering education. We begin by tracing
historical and technological disruptions to provide context and then introduce
key terms such as machine learning and deep learning and the underlying
mechanisms of recent advancements, namely attention/transformer models and
graphics processing units. The heart of our investigation lies in the
application of an LLM-based chatbot in a graduate fluid mechanics course. We
developed a question bank from the course material and assessed the chatbot's
ability to provide accurate, insightful responses. The results are encouraging,
demonstrating not only the bot's ability to effectively answer complex
questions but also the potential advantages of chatbot usage in the classroom,
such as the promotion of self-paced learning, the provision of instantaneous
feedback, and the reduction of instructors' workload. The study also examines
the transformative effect of intelligent prompting on enhancing the chatbot's
performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate how powerful plugins like Wolfram
Alpha for mathematical problem-solving and code interpretation can
significantly extend the chatbot's capabilities, transforming it into a
comprehensive educational tool. While acknowledging the challenges and ethical
implications surrounding the use of such AI models in education, we advocate

"The Impact of AI in Physics Education: A Comprehensive Review from GCSE
  to University Levels","With the rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI), its potential
implications for higher education have become a focal point of interest. This
study delves into the capabilities of AI in Physics Education and offers
actionable AI policy recommendations. Using a Large Language Model (LLM), we
assessed its ability to answer 1337 Physics exam questions spanning GCSE,
A-Level, and Introductory University curricula. We employed various AI
prompting techniques: Zero Shot, In Context Learning, and Confirmatory
Checking, which merges Chain of Thought reasoning with Reflection. The AI's
proficiency varied across academic levels: it scored an average of 83.4% on
GCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions, with an
overall average of 59.9% using the most effective prompting technique. In a
separate test, the LLM's accuracy on 5000 mathematical operations was found to
decrease as the number of digits increased. Furthermore, when evaluated as a
marking tool, the LLM's concordance with human markers averaged at 50.8%, with
notable inaccuracies in marking straightforward questions, like
multiple-choice. Given these results, our recommendations underscore caution:
while current LLMs can consistently perform well on Physics questions at
earlier educational stages, their efficacy diminishes with advanced content and
complex calculations. LLM outputs often showcase novel methods not in the
syllabus, excessive verbosity, and miscalculations in basic arithmetic. This
suggests that at university, there's no substantial threat from LLMs for
non-invigilated Physics questions. However, given the LLMs' considerable
proficiency in writing Physics essays and coding abilities, non-invigilated
examinations of these skills in Physics are highly vulnerable to automated
completion by LLMs. This vulnerability also extends to Physics questions
pitched at lower academic levels.",2023-09-10,2023,2023-09,education

Generative AI in the Classroom: Can Students Remain Active Learners?,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) can be seen as a double-edged weapon
in education. Indeed, it may provide personalized, interactive and empowering
pedagogical sequences that could favor students' intrinsic motivation, active
engagement and help them have more control over their learning. But at the same
time, other GAI properties such as the lack of uncertainty signalling even in
cases of failure (particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs)) could lead to
opposite effects, e.g. over-estimation of one's own competencies, passiveness,
loss of curious and critical-thinking sense, etc.
  These negative effects are due in particular to the lack of a pedagogical
stance in these models' behaviors. Indeed, as opposed to standard pedagogical
activities, GAI systems are often designed to answers users' inquiries easily

  Improvements","Prior work has established the importance of integrating AI ethics topics
into computer and data sciences curricula. We provide evidence suggesting that
one of the critical objectives of AI Ethics education must be to raise
awareness of AI harms. While there are various sources to learn about such
harms, The AI Incident Database (AIID) is one of the few attempts at offering a
relatively comprehensive database indexing prior instances of harms or near
harms stemming from the deployment of AI technologies in the real world. This
study assesses the effectiveness of AIID as an educational tool to raise
awareness regarding the prevalence and severity of AI harms in socially
high-stakes domains. We present findings obtained through a classroom study
conducted at an R1 institution as part of a course focused on the societal and
ethical considerations around AI and ML. Our qualitative findings characterize
students' initial perceptions of core topics in AI ethics and their desire to
close the educational gap between their technical skills and their ability to
think systematically about ethical and societal aspects of their work. We find
that interacting with the database helps students better understand the
magnitude and severity of AI harms and instills in them a sense of urgency
around (a) designing functional and safe AI and (b) strengthening governance
and accountability mechanisms. Finally, we compile students' feedback about the
tool and our class activity into actionable recommendations for the database
development team and the broader community to improve awareness of AI harms in
AI ethics education.",2023-10-10,2023,2023-10,education
"Gender, Age, and Technology Education Influence the Adoption and
  Appropriation of LLMs","Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have become increasingly
integrated into critical activities of daily life, raising concerns about
equitable access and utilization across diverse demographics. This study
investigates the usage of LLMs among 1,500 representative US citizens.
Remarkably, 42% of participants reported utilizing an LLM. Our findings reveal
a gender gap in LLM technology adoption (more male users than female users)
with complex interaction patterns regarding age. Technology-related education
eliminates the gender gap in our sample. Moreover, expert users are more likely
than novices to list professional tasks as typical application scenarios,
suggesting discrepancies in effective usage at the workplace. These results
underscore the importance of providing education in artificial intelligence in
our technology-driven society to promote equitable access to and benefits from
LLMs. We urge for both international replication beyond the US and longitudinal

"BC4LLM: Trusted Artificial Intelligence When Blockchain Meets Large
  Language Models","In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are
reshaping society's production methods and productivity, and also changing the
paradigm of scientific research. Among them, the AI language model represented
by ChatGPT has made great progress. Such large language models (LLMs) serve
people in the form of AI-generated content (AIGC) and are widely used in
consulting, healthcare, and education. However, it is difficult to guarantee
the authenticity and reliability of AIGC learning data. In addition, there are
also hidden dangers of privacy disclosure in distributed AI training. Moreover,
the content generated by LLMs is difficult to identify and trace, and it is
difficult to cross-platform mutual recognition. The above information security
issues in the coming era of AI powered by LLMs will be infinitely amplified and
affect everyone's life. Therefore, we consider empowering LLMs using blockchain
technology with superior security features to propose a vision for trusted AI.
This paper mainly introduces the motivation and technical route of blockchain
for LLM (BC4LLM), including reliable learning corpus, secure training process,
and identifiable generated content. Meanwhile, this paper also reviews the
potential applications and future challenges, especially in the frontier
communication networks field, including network resource allocation, dynamic
spectrum sharing, and semantic communication. Based on the above work combined
and the prospect of blockchain and LLMs, it is expected to help the early
realization of trusted AI and provide guidance for the academic community.",2023-10-10,2023,2023-10,education
"Opportunities for Adaptive Experiments to Enable Continuous Improvement
  in Computer Science Education","Randomized A/B comparisons of alternative pedagogical strategies or other
course improvements could provide useful empirical evidence for instructor
decision-making. However, traditional experiments do not provide a
straightforward pathway to rapidly utilize data, increasing the chances that
students in an experiment experience the best conditions. Drawing inspiration
from the use of machine learning and experimentation in product development at
leading technology companies, we explore how adaptive experimentation might aid
continuous course improvement. In adaptive experiments, data is analyzed and
utilized as different conditions are deployed to students. This can be achieved
using machine learning algorithms to identify which actions are more beneficial
in improving students' learning experiences and outcomes. These algorithms can
then dynamically deploy the most effective conditions in subsequent
interactions with students, resulting in better support for students' needs. We
illustrate this approach with a case study that provides a side-by-side
comparison of traditional and adaptive experiments on adding self-explanation
prompts in online homework problems in a CS1 course. This work paves the way
for exploring the importance of adaptive experiments in bridging research and
practice to achieve continuous improvement in educational settings.",2023-10-18,2023,2023-10,education

"Leveraging generative artificial intelligence to simulate student
  learning behavior","Student simulation presents a transformative approach to enhance learning
outcomes, advance educational research, and ultimately shape the future of
effective pedagogy. We explore the feasibility of using large language models
(LLMs), a remarkable achievement in AI, to simulate student learning behaviors.
Unlike conventional machine learning based prediction, we leverage LLMs to
instantiate virtual students with specific demographics and uncover intricate
correlations among learning experiences, course materials, understanding
levels, and engagement. Our objective is not merely to predict learning
outcomes but to replicate learning behaviors and patterns of real students. We
validate this hypothesis through three experiments. The first experiment, based
on a dataset of N = 145, simulates student learning outcomes from demographic
data, revealing parallels with actual students concerning various demographic
factors. The second experiment (N = 4524) results in increasingly realistic
simulated behaviors with more assessment history for virtual students
modelling. The third experiment (N = 27), incorporating prior knowledge and
course interactions, indicates a strong link between virtual students' learning
behaviors and fine-grained mappings from test questions, course materials,
engagement and understanding levels. Collectively, these findings deepen our
understanding of LLMs and demonstrate its viability for student simulation,
empowering more adaptable curricula design to enhance inclusivity and
educational effectiveness.",2023-10-30,2023,2023-10,education
"Plagiarism and AI Assistance Misuse in Web Programming: Unfair Benefits

tasks independently, with a submission to plagiarize, and with the help of AI
assistance (ChatGPT). Our study shows that students who are involved in such
misconducts get comparable test marks with less completion time. Plagiarized
submissions are similar to the independent ones except in trivial aspects such

"Augmenting deep neural networks with symbolic knowledge: Towards
  trustworthy and interpretable AI for education","Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown to be amongst the most important
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in educational applications, providing
adaptive educational services. However, their educational potential is limited
in practice due to three major challenges: i) difficulty in incorporating
symbolic educational knowledge (e.g., causal relationships, and practitioners'
knowledge) in their development, ii) learning and reflecting biases, and iii)
lack of interpretability. Given the high-risk nature of education, the
integration of educational knowledge into ANNs becomes crucial for developing
AI applications that adhere to essential educational restrictions, and provide
interpretability over the predictions. This research argues that the
neural-symbolic family of AI has the potential to address the named challenges.
To this end, it adapts a neural-symbolic AI framework and accordingly develops
an approach called NSAI, that injects and extracts educational knowledge into
and from deep neural networks, for modelling learners computational thinking.
Our findings reveal that the NSAI approach has better generalizability compared
to deep neural networks trained merely on training data, as well as training
data augmented by SMOTE and autoencoder methods. More importantly, unlike the
other models, the NSAI approach prioritises robust representations that capture
causal relationships between input features and output labels, ensuring safety
in learning to avoid spurious correlations and control biases in training data.
Furthermore, the NSAI approach enables the extraction of rules from the learned
network, facilitating interpretation and reasoning about the path to
predictions, as well as refining the initial educational knowledge. These
findings imply that neural-symbolic AI can overcome the limitations of ANNs in
education, enabling trustworthy and interpretable applications.",2023-11-01,2023,2023-11,education

"Analysis of the User Perception of Chatbots in Education Using A Partial
  Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling Approach","The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education is a recent
development, with chatbots emerging as a noteworthy addition to this

students need to adapt swiftly to excel in this dynamic environment.
Consequently, understanding the acceptance of chatbots, particularly those
employing Large Language Model (LLM) such as Chat Generative Pretrained

deeper understanding of such a collaborative process, we conduct ten co-design
sessions with ML software practitioners, educators, and students. In the
sessions, teachers and students work with ML engineers, UX designers, and legal
practitioners to define dataset characteristics for a given ML application. We
find that stakeholders contextualize data based on their domain and procedural
knowledge, proactively design data requirements to mitigate downstream harms
and data reliability concerns, and exhibit role-based collaborative strategies
and contribution patterns. Further, we find that beyond a seat at the table,

Gemini Pro Defeated by GPT-4V: Evidence from Education,"This study compared the classification performance of Gemini Pro and GPT-4V
in educational settings. Employing visual question answering (VQA) techniques,
the study examined both models' abilities to read text-based rubrics and then
automatically score student-drawn models in science education. We employed both
quantitative and qualitative analyses using a dataset derived from
student-drawn scientific models and employing NERIF (Notation-Enhanced Rubrics

significantly outperforms Gemini Pro in terms of scoring accuracy and Quadratic
Weighted Kappa. The qualitative analysis reveals that the differences may be
due to the models' ability to process fine-grained texts in images and overall
image classification performance. Even adapting the NERIF approach by further
de-sizing the input images, Gemini Pro seems not able to perform as well as
GPT-4V. The findings suggest GPT-4V's superior capability in handling complex

"Adapting Large Language Models for Education: Foundational Capabilities,
  Potentials, and Challenges","Online education platforms, leveraging the internet to distribute education
resources, seek to provide convenient education but often fall short in
real-time communication with students. They often struggle to address the
diverse obstacles students encounter throughout their learning journey. Solving
the problems encountered by students poses a significant challenge for
traditional deep learning models, as it requires not only a broad spectrum of
subject knowledge but also the ability to understand what constitutes a
student's individual difficulties. It's challenging for traditional machine
learning models, as they lack the capacity to comprehend students' personalized
needs. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers the
possibility for resolving this issue by comprehending individual requests.
Although LLMs have been successful in various fields, creating an LLM-based

Grounded in theory of multimedia learning, this paper explores the
transformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by
presenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios. Possible applications for
MLLMs could range from content creation to tailored support for learning,
fostering competencies in scientific practices, and providing assessment and

but can be multimodal, increasing thus personalization, accessibility, and
potential learning effectiveness. Besides many opportunities, challenges such
as data protection and ethical considerations become more salient, calling for
robust frameworks to ensure responsible integration. This paper underscores the
necessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology
complements rather than supplants the educator's role, ensuring thus an
effective and ethical use of AI in science education. It calls for further
research to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs on the evolving role of
educators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other
disciplines. Through the exploration of potentials, challenges, and future

Mastery Guided Non-parametric Clustering to Scale-up Strategy Prediction,"Predicting the strategy (sequence of concepts) that a student is likely to
use in problem-solving helps Adaptive Instructional Systems (AISs) better adapt
themselves to different types of learners based on their learning abilities.
This can lead to a more dynamic, engaging, and personalized experience for
students. To scale up training a prediction model (such as LSTMs) over
large-scale education datasets, we develop a non-parametric approach to cluster
symmetric instances in the data. Specifically, we learn a representation based
on Node2Vec that encodes symmetries over mastery or skill level since, to solve
a problem, it is natural that a student's strategy is likely to involve
concepts in which they have gained mastery. Using this representation, we use
DP-Means to group symmetric instances through a coarse-to-fine refinement of
the clusters. We apply our model to learn strategies for Math learning from
large-scale datasets from MATHia, a leading AIS for middle-school math
learning. Our results illustrate that our approach can consistently achieve
high accuracy using a small sample that is representative of the full dataset.
Further, we show that this approach helps us learn strategies with high
accuracy for students at different skill levels, i.e., leveraging symmetries

"Identifying Student Profiles Within Online Judge Systems Using
  Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Online Judge (OJ) systems are typically considered within programming-related
courses as they yield fast and objective assessments of the code developed by
the students. Such an evaluation generally provides a single decision based on
a rubric, most commonly whether the submission successfully accomplished the
assignment. Nevertheless, since in an educational context such information may
be deemed insufficient, it would be beneficial for both the student and the
instructor to receive additional feedback about the overall development of the
task. This work aims to tackle this limitation by considering the further
exploitation of the information gathered by the OJ and automatically inferring
feedback for both the student and the instructor. More precisely, we consider
the use of learning-based schemes -- particularly, multi-instance learning
(MIL) and classical machine learning formulations -- to model student behavior.
Besides, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is contemplated to provide
human-understandable feedback. The proposal has been evaluated considering a
case of study comprising 2500 submissions from roughly 90 different students
from a programming-related course in a computer science degree. The results
obtained validate the proposal: The model is capable of significantly
predicting the user outcome (either passing or failing the assignment) solely
based on the behavioral pattern inferred by the submissions provided to the OJ.
Moreover, the proposal is able to identify prone-to-fail student groups and
profiles as well as other relevant information, which eventually serves as
feedback to both the student and the instructor.",2024-01-29,2024,2024-01,education

"Improving the Validity of Automatically Generated Feedback via
  Reinforcement Learning","Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in
intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to
improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback
generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid
especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the
problem, the solution, and where the student's error lies. Feedback also has to
be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as
explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other
desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically
generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and
alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show
that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and
LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation
that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning
(RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4's annotations to create preferences over
feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference
optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the
correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source
LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case
studies, and outline several areas for future work.",2024-03-02,2024,2024-03,education
"Evaluating and Optimizing Educational Content with Large Language Model
  Judgments","Creating effective educational materials generally requires expensive and
time-consuming studies of student learning outcomes. To overcome this barrier,
one idea is to build computational models of student learning and use them to
optimize instructional materials. However, it is difficult to model the
cognitive processes of learning dynamics. We propose an alternative approach
that uses Language Models (LMs) as educational experts to assess the impact of
various instructions on learning outcomes. Specifically, we use GPT-3.5 to
evaluate the overall effect of instructional materials on different student
groups and find that it can replicate well-established educational findings
such as the Expertise Reversal Effect and the Variability Effect. This
demonstrates the potential of LMs as reliable evaluators of educational
content. Building on this insight, we introduce an instruction optimization
approach in which one LM generates instructional materials using the judgments
of another LM as a reward function. We apply this approach to create math word
problem worksheets aimed at maximizing student learning gains. Human teachers'
evaluations of these LM-generated worksheets show a significant alignment
between the LM judgments and human teacher preferences. We conclude by
discussing potential divergences between human and LM opinions and the
resulting pitfalls of automating instructional design.",2024-03-05,2024,2024-03,education

"Legally Binding but Unfair? Towards Assessing Fairness of Privacy
  Policies","Privacy policies are expected to inform data subjects about their data
protection rights and should explain the data controller's data management
practices. Privacy policies only fulfill their purpose, if they are correctly
interpreted, understood, and trusted by the data subject. This implies that a
privacy policy is written in a fair way, e.g., it does not use polarizing
terms, does not require a certain education, or does not assume a particular
social background. We outline our approach to assessing fairness in privacy
policies. We identify from fundamental legal sources and fairness research, how
the dimensions informational fairness, representational fairness and ethics /
morality are related to privacy policies. We propose options to automatically
assess policies in these fairness dimensions, based on text statistics,
linguistic methods and artificial intelligence. We conduct initial experiments
with German privacy policies to provide evidence that our approach is
applicable. Our experiments indicate that there are issues in all three
dimensions of fairness. This is important, as future privacy policies may be
used in a corpus for legal artificial intelligence models.",2024-03-12,2024,2024-03,education
A Survey of Explainable Knowledge Tracing,"With the long term accumulation of high quality educational data, artificial
intelligence has shown excellent performance in knowledge tracing. However, due
to the lack of interpretability and transparency of some algorithms, this
approach will result in reduced stakeholder trust and a decreased acceptance of
intelligent decisions. Therefore, algorithms need to achieve high accuracy, and
users need to understand the internal operating mechanism and provide reliable
explanations for decisions. This paper thoroughly analyzes the interpretability
of KT algorithms. First, the concepts and common methods of explainable
artificial intelligence and knowledge tracing are introduced. Next, explainable
knowledge tracing models are classified into two categories: transparent models
and black box models. Then, the interpretable methods used are reviewed from
three stages: ante hoc interpretable methods, post hoc interpretable methods,
and other dimensions. It is worth noting that current evaluation methods for
explainable knowledge tracing are lacking. Hence, contrast and deletion
experiments are conducted to explain the prediction results of the deep
knowledge tracing model on the ASSISTment2009 by using three XAI methods.
Moreover, this paper offers some insights into evaluation methods from the

"AI and personalized learning: bridging the gap with modern educational
  goals","Personalized learning (PL) aspires to provide an alternative to the
one-size-fits-all approach in education. Technology-based PL solutions have
shown notable effectiveness in enhancing learning performance. However, their
alignment with the broader goals of modern education is inconsistent across
technologies and research areas. In this paper, we examine the characteristics
of AI-driven PL solutions in light of the goals outlined in the OECD Learning
Compass 2030. Our analysis indicates a gap between the objectives of modern
education and the technological approach to PL. We identify areas where the
AI-based PL solutions could embrace essential elements of contemporary
education, such as fostering learner's agency, cognitive engagement, and
general competencies. While the PL solutions that narrowly focus on
domain-specific knowledge acquisition are instrumental in aiding learning
processes, the PL envisioned by educational experts extends beyond simple
technological tools and requires a holistic change in the educational system.
Finally, we explore the potential of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, and
propose a hybrid model that blends artificial intelligence with a
collaborative, teacher-facilitated approach to personalized learning.",2024-04-03,2024,2024-04,education
AI-Tutoring in Software Engineering Education,"With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in various
domains, the education sector is set for transformation. The potential of
AI-driven tools in enhancing the learning experience, especially in
programming, is immense. However, the scientific evaluation of Large Language
Models (LLMs) used in Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) as an
AI-Tutor remains largely unexplored. Therefore, there is a need to understand
how students interact with such AI-Tutors and to analyze their experiences. In
this paper, we conducted an exploratory case study by integrating the
GPT-3.5-Turbo model as an AI-Tutor within the APAS Artemis. Through a
combination of empirical data collection and an exploratory survey, we
identified different user types based on their interaction patterns with the
AI-Tutor. Additionally, the findings highlight advantages, such as timely
feedback and scalability. However, challenges like generic responses and
students' concerns about a learning progress inhibition when using the AI-Tutor
were also evident. This research adds to the discourse on AI's role in
education.",2024-04-03,2024,2024-04,education
"The Promises and Pitfalls of Using Language Models to Measure
  Instruction Quality in Education","Assessing instruction quality is a fundamental component of any improvement
efforts in the education system. However, traditional manual assessments are
expensive, subjective, and heavily dependent on observers' expertise and
idiosyncratic factors, preventing teachers from getting timely and frequent
feedback. Different from prior research that mostly focuses on low-inference
instructional practices on a singular basis, this paper presents the first
study that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assess
multiple high-inference instructional practices in two distinct educational
settings: in-person K-12 classrooms and simulated performance tasks for
pre-service teachers. This is also the first study that applies NLP to measure
a teaching practice that is widely acknowledged to be particularly effective
for students with special needs. We confront two challenges inherent in
NLP-based instructional analysis, including noisy and long input data and
highly skewed distributions of human ratings. Our results suggest that
pretrained Language Models (PLMs) demonstrate performances comparable to the
agreement level of human raters for variables that are more discrete and
require lower inference, but their efficacy diminishes with more complex
teaching practices. Interestingly, using only teachers' utterances as input
yields strong results for student-centered variables, alleviating common
concerns over the difficulty of collecting and transcribing high-quality
student speech data in in-person teaching settings. Our findings highlight both
the potential and the limitations of current NLP techniques in the education
domain, opening avenues for further exploration.",2024-04-03,2024,2024-04,education

mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in
STEM education, while favouring software support for this transition by
exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies. What follows is a brief
description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise.
  The 12th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational
Software(ThEdu'23), was a satellite event of the 29th international Conference
on Automated Deduction (CADE 2023), July 1-4, 2023, Rome, Italy. ThEdu'23 was
very successful, with one invited talk, by Yves Bertot (Inria, France), ""The
challenges of using Type Theory to teach Mathematics"", and seven regular
contributions. An open call for papers was then issued, to which eight
contributions were submitted. Seven submissions have been accepted by our
reviewers, who jointly produced at least three careful reports on each of the
contributions. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present

"Sentiment analysis and random forest to classify LLM versus human source
  applied to Scientific Texts","After the launch of ChatGPT v.4 there has been a global vivid discussion on
the ability of this artificial intelligence powered platform and some other
similar ones for the automatic production of all kinds of texts, including
scientific and technical texts. This has triggered a reflection in many
institutions on whether education and academic procedures should be adapted to
the fact that in future many texts we read will not be written by humans
(students, scholars, etc.), at least, not entirely. In this work it is proposed
a new methodology to classify texts coming from an automatic text production
engine or a human, based on Sentiment Analysis as a source for feature
engineering independent variables and then train with them a Random Forest
classification algorithm. Using four different sentiment lexicons, a number of
new features where produced, and then fed to a machine learning random forest
methodology, to train such a model. Results seem very convincing that this may
be a promising research line to detect fraud, in such environments where human

"Clue-Instruct: Text-Based Clue Generation for Educational Crossword
  Puzzles","Crossword puzzles are popular linguistic games often used as tools to engage
students in learning. Educational crosswords are characterized by less cryptic
and more factual clues that distinguish them from traditional crossword
puzzles. Despite there exist several publicly available clue-answer pair
databases for traditional crosswords, educational clue-answer pairs datasets
are missing. In this article, we propose a methodology to build educational
clue generation datasets that can be used to instruct Large Language Models
(LLMs). By gathering from Wikipedia pages informative content associated with
relevant keywords, we use Large Language Models to automatically generate
pedagogical clues related to the given input keyword and its context. With such
an approach, we created clue-instruct, a dataset containing 44,075 unique
examples with text-keyword pairs associated with three distinct crossword
clues. We used clue-instruct to instruct different LLMs to generate educational
clues from a given input content and keyword. Both human and automatic

"Leveraging Large Language Model as Simulated Patients for Clinical
  Education","Simulated Patients (SPs) play a crucial role in clinical medical education by
providing realistic scenarios for student practice. However, the high cost of
training and hiring qualified SPs, along with the heavy workload and potential
risks they face in consistently portraying actual patients, limit students'
access to this type of clinical training. Consequently, the integration of
computer program-based simulated patients has emerged as a valuable educational
tool in recent years. With the rapid development of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their exceptional capabilities in conversational artificial
intelligence and role-playing have been demonstrated, making them a feasible
option for implementing Virtual Simulated Patient (VSP). In this paper, we
present an integrated model-agnostic framework called CureFun that harnesses
the potential of LLMs in clinical medical education. This framework facilitates
natural conversations between students and simulated patients, evaluates their
dialogue, and provides suggestions to enhance students' clinical inquiry
skills. Through comprehensive evaluations, our approach demonstrates more
authentic and professional SP-scenario dialogue flows compared to other
LLM-based chatbots, thus proving its proficiency in simulating patients.
Additionally, leveraging CureFun's evaluation ability, we assess several

"Cross-Data Knowledge Graph Construction for LLM-enabled Educational
  Question-Answering System: A Case Study at HCMUT","In today's rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) have emerged as a vibrant research topic. LLMs find
applications in various fields and contribute significantly. Despite their
powerful language capabilities, similar to pre-trained language models (PLMs),
LLMs still face challenges in remembering events, incorporating new
information, and addressing domain-specific issues or hallucinations. To
overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) techniques, some others have proposed the integration of LLMs
with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to provide factual context, thereby improving
performance and delivering more accurate feedback to user queries.
  Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress. With the
technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital

transformative potential. This paper introduces Iris, a chat-based virtual
tutor integrated into the interactive learning platform Artemis that offers
personalized, context-aware assistance in large-scale educational settings.
Iris supports computer science students by guiding them through programming
exercises and is designed to act as a tutor in a didactically meaningful way.
Its calibrated assistance avoids revealing complete solutions, offering subtle
hints or counter-questions to foster independent problem-solving skills. For
each question, it issues multiple prompts in a Chain-of-Thought to

Towards Integrating Emerging AI Applications in SE Education,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have been incorporated into modern
learning environments and software engineering (SE) courses and curricula for
several years. However, with the significant rise in popularity of large
language models (LLMs) in general, and OpenAI's LLM-powered chatbot ChatGPT in
particular in the last year, educators are faced with rapidly changing
classroom environments and disrupted teaching principles. Examples range from
programming assignment solutions that are fully generated via ChatGPT, to
various forms of cheating during exams. However, despite these negative aspects
and emerging challenges, AI tools in general, and LLM applications in
particular, can also provide significant opportunities in a wide variety of SE
courses, supporting both students and educators in meaningful ways. In this
early research paper, we present preliminary results of a systematic analysis
of current trends in the area of AI, and how they can be integrated into
university-level SE curricula, guidelines, and approaches to support both
instructors and learners. We collected both teaching and research papers and
analyzed their potential usage in SE education, using the ACM Computer Science
Curriculum Guidelines CS2023. As an initial outcome, we discuss a series of
opportunities for AI applications and further research areas.",2024-05-28,2024,2024-05,education
"Interpret3C: Interpretable Student Clustering Through Individualized
  Feature Selection","Clustering in education, particularly in large-scale online environments like
MOOCs, is essential for understanding and adapting to diverse student needs.
However, the effectiveness of clustering depends on its interpretability, which
becomes challenging with high-dimensional data. Existing clustering approaches
often neglect individual differences in feature importance and rely on a
homogenized feature set. Addressing this gap, we introduce Interpret3C
(Interpretable Conditional Computation Clustering), a novel clustering pipeline
that incorporates interpretable neural networks (NNs) in an unsupervised
learning context. This method leverages adaptive gating in NNs to select
features for each student. Then, clustering is performed using the most
relevant features per student, enhancing clusters' relevance and
interpretability. We use Interpret3C to analyze the behavioral clusters
considering individual feature importances in a MOOC with over 5,000 students.
This research contributes to the field by offering a scalable, robust
clustering methodology and an educational case study that respects individual
student differences and improves interpretability for high-dimensional data.",2024-05-28,2024,2024-05,education

"The Future of Child Development in the AI Era. Cross-Disciplinary
  Perspectives Between AI and Child Development Experts","This report explores the potential implications of rapidly integrating
Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications into children's environments. The
introduction of AI in our daily lives necessitates scrutiny considering the
significant role of the environment in shaping cognition, socio-emotional
skills, and behaviors, especially during the first 25 years of cerebral
development. As AI becomes prevalent in educational and leisure activities, it
will significantly modify the experiences of children and adolescents,
presenting both challenges and opportunities for their developmental
trajectories. This analysis was informed by consulting with 15 experts from
pertinent disciplines (AI, product development, child development, and
neurosciences), along with a comprehensive review of scientific literature on
children development and child-technology interactions. Overall, AI experts
anticipate that AI will transform leisure activities, revolutionize education,

An Automatic Question Usability Evaluation Toolkit,"Evaluating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) involves either labor intensive
human assessments or automated methods that prioritize readability, often
overlooking deeper question design flaws. To address this issue, we introduce
the Scalable Automatic Question Usability Evaluation Toolkit (SAQUET), an
open-source tool that leverages the Item-Writing Flaws (IWF) rubric for a
comprehensive and automated quality evaluation of MCQs. By harnessing the
latest in large language models such as GPT-4, advanced word embeddings, and
Transformers designed to analyze textual complexity, SAQUET effectively
pinpoints and assesses a wide array of flaws in MCQs. We first demonstrate the
discrepancy between commonly used automated evaluation metrics and the human
assessment of MCQ quality. Then we evaluate SAQUET on a diverse dataset of MCQs
across the five domains of Chemistry, Statistics, Computer Science, Humanities,

"Synthetic Patients: Simulating Difficult Conversations with Multimodal
  Generative AI for Medical Education","Problem: Effective patient-centered communication is a core competency for
physicians. However, both seasoned providers and medical trainees report
decreased confidence in leading conversations on sensitive topics such as goals
of care or end-of-life discussions. The significant administrative burden and
the resources required to provide dedicated training in leading difficult
conversations has been a long-standing problem in medical education.
  Approach: In this work, we present a novel educational tool designed to
facilitate interactive, real-time simulations of difficult conversations in a
video-based format through the use of multimodal generative artificial
intelligence (AI). Leveraging recent advances in language modeling, computer
vision, and generative audio, this tool creates realistic, interactive
scenarios with avatars, or ""synthetic patients."" These synthetic patients
interact with users throughout various stages of medical care using a
custom-built video chat application, offering learners the chance to practice
conversations with patients from diverse belief systems, personalities, and
ethnic backgrounds.
  Outcomes: While the development of this platform demanded substantial upfront
investment in labor, it offers a highly-realistic simulation experience with
minimal financial investment. For medical trainees, this educational tool can
be implemented within programs to simulate patient-provider conversations and
can be incorporated into existing palliative care curriculum to provide a
scalable, high-fidelity simulation environment for mastering difficult
conversations.
  Next Steps: Future developments will explore enhancing the authenticity of
these encounters by working with patients to incorporate their histories and
personalities, as well as employing the use of AI-generated evaluations to
offer immediate, constructive feedback to learners post-simulation.",2024-05-30,2024,2024-05,education
Visions of a Discipline: Analyzing Introductory AI Courses on YouTube,"Education plays an indispensable role in fostering societal well-being and is
widely regarded as one of the most influential factors in shaping the future of
generations to come. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more deeply
integrated into our daily lives and the workforce, educational institutions at
all levels are directing their focus on resources that cater to AI education.
Our work investigates the current landscape of introductory AI courses on
YouTube, and the potential for introducing ethics in this context. We
qualitatively analyze the 20 most watched introductory AI courses on YouTube,
coding a total of 92.2 hours of educational content viewed by close to 50
million people. Introductory AI courses do not meaningfully engage with ethical
or societal challenges of AI (RQ1). When \textit{defining and framing AI},
introductory AI courses foreground excitement around AI's transformative role
in society, over-exaggerate AI's current and future abilities, and
anthropomorphize AI (RQ2). In \textit{teaching AI}, we see a widespread
reliance on corporate AI tools and frameworks as well as a prioritization on a
hands-on approach to learning rather than on conceptual foundations (RQ3). In
promoting key \textit{AI practices}, introductory AI courses abstract away
entirely the socio-technical nature of AI classification and prediction, for
example by favoring data quantity over data quality (RQ4). We extend our
analysis with recommendations that aim to integrate ethical reflections into
introductory AI courses. We recommend that introductory AI courses should (1)
highlight ethical challenges of AI to present a more balanced perspective, (2)
raise ethical issues explicitly relevant to the technical concepts discussed

"Generative AI and Digital Neocolonialism in Global Education: Towards an
  Equitable Framework","This paper critically discusses how generative artificial intelligence
(GenAI) might impose Western ideologies on non-Western societies, perpetuating
digital neocolonialism in education through its inherent biases. It further
suggests strategies for local and global stakeholders to mitigate these
effects. Our discussions demonstrated that GenAI can foster cultural
imperialism by generating content that primarily incorporates cultural
references and examples relevant to Western students, thereby alienating
students from non-Western backgrounds. Also, the predominant use of Western
languages by GenAI can marginalize non-dominant languages, making educational
content less accessible to speakers of indigenous languages and potentially
impacting their ability to learn in their first language. Additionally, GenAI
often generates content and curricula that reflect the perspectives of
technologically dominant countries, overshadowing marginalized indigenous
knowledge and practices. Moreover, the cost of access to GenAI intensifies
educational inequality and the control of GenAI data could lead to commercial
exploitation without benefiting local students and their communities. We
propose human-centric reforms to prioritize cultural diversity and equity in
GenAI development; a liberatory design to empower educators and students to
identify and dismantle the oppressive structures within GenAI applications;
foresight by design to create an adjustable GenAI system to meet future
educational needs; and finally, effective prompting skills to reduce the
retrieval of neocolonial outputs.",2024-06-05,2024,2024-06,education

"Leveraging Pedagogical Theories to Understand Student Learning Process
  with Graph-based Reasonable Knowledge Tracing","Knowledge tracing (KT) is a crucial task in intelligent education, focusing
on predicting students' performance on given questions to trace their evolving
knowledge. The advancement of deep learning in this field has led to
deep-learning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models that prioritize high predictive
accuracy. However, many existing DLKT methods overlook the fundamental goal of
tracking students' dynamical knowledge mastery. These models do not explicitly
model knowledge mastery tracing processes or yield unreasonable results that
educators find difficulty to comprehend and apply in real teaching scenarios.
In response, our research conducts a preliminary analysis of mainstream KT
approaches to highlight and explain such unreasonableness. We introduce GRKT, a
graph-based reasonable knowledge tracing method to address these issues. By
leveraging graph neural networks, our approach delves into the mutual
influences of knowledge concepts, offering a more accurate representation of
how the knowledge mastery evolves throughout the learning process.
Additionally, we propose a fine-grained and psychological three-stage modeling
process as knowledge retrieval, memory strengthening, and knowledge
learning/forgetting, to conduct a more reasonable knowledge tracing process.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GRKT outperforms eleven baselines

We test this hypothesis using data collected from an artificial intelligence
course with 105 participants (N=105) at a university in India. The AI course
had two programming assignments. Plagiarism through collusion was quantified
using the Measure of Software Similarity (MOSS) tool. Students were educated
about what constitutes academic dishonesty and were required to take an honor
pledge before the start of the second take-home programming assignment. The two

to monitor students' knowledge states throughout a learning period. Common KT
approaches involve predicting the probability of a student correctly answering
the next question based on their exercise history. However, these methods often
suffer from performance degradation when faced with the scarcity of student
interactions in new education systems. To address this, we leverage student
interactions from existing education systems to mitigate performance
degradation caused by limited training data. Nevertheless, these interactions
exhibit significant differences since they are derived from different education
systems. To address this issue, we propose a domain generalization approach for
knowledge tracing, where existing education systems are considered source

"Teacher agency in the age of generative AI: towards a framework of
  hybrid intelligence for learning design","Generative AI (genAI) is being used in education for different purposes. From
the teachers' perspective, genAI can support activities such as learning

agency. While GenAI can support certain processes of idea generation and
co-creation, GenAI has the potential to negatively affect professional agency
due to teachers' limited power to (i) act, (ii) affect matters, and (iii) make
decisions or choices, as well as the possibility to (iv) take a stance. Agency

from 48 students interacting with ChatGPT in a master's level data
visualization course over one semester. We then developed a coding scheme,
grounded in the literature on cognitive levels and thematic analysis, to
categorize students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT. Furthermore, we present
a visual analytics system, StuGPTViz, that tracks and compares temporal
patterns in student prompts and the quality of ChatGPT's responses at multiple
scales, revealing significant pedagogical insights for instructors. We
validated the system's effectiveness through expert interviews with six data
visualization instructors and three case studies. The results confirmed
StuGPTViz's capacity to enhance educators' insights into the pedagogical value

Custom GPT with the aim of achieving more reliable results and testing whether
it can provide design students with constructive feedback. The findings
include: First,through several rounds of iterations the inter-reliability
between GPT and human raters reached a level that is generally accepted by
educators. This indicates that by providing accurate prompts to GPT,and
continuously iterating to build a Custom GPT, it can be used to effectively
grade students' design assignments, serving as a reliable complement to human
raters. Second, the intra-reliability of GPT's scoring at different times is
between 0.65 and 0.78. This indicates that, with adequate instructions, a
Custom GPT gives consistent results which is a precondition for grading
students. As consistency and comparability are the two main rules to ensure the
reliability of educational assessment, this study has looked at whether a
Custom GPT can be developed that adheres to these two rules. We finish the
paper by testing whether Custom GPT can provide students with useful feedback
and reflecting on how educators can develop and iterate a Custom GPT to serve

"Optimizing Student Ability Assessment: A Hierarchy Constraint-Aware
  Cognitive Diagnosis Framework for Educational Contexts","Cognitive diagnosis (CD) aims to reveal students' proficiency in specific
knowledge concepts. With the increasing adoption of intelligent education
applications, accurately assessing students' knowledge mastery has become an
urgent challenge. Although existing cognitive diagnosis frameworks enhance
diagnostic accuracy by analyzing students' explicit response records, they
primarily focus on individual knowledge state, failing to adequately reflect
the relative ability performance of students within hierarchies. To address
this, we propose the Hierarchy Constraint-Aware Cognitive Diagnosis Framework
(HCD), designed to more accurately represent student ability performance within
real educational contexts. Specifically, the framework introduces a hierarchy
mapping layer to identify students' levels. It then employs a hierarchy
convolution-enhanced attention layer for in-depth analysis of knowledge
concepts performance among students at the same level, uncovering nuanced
differences. A hierarchy inter-sampling attention layer captures performance
differences across hierarchies, offering a comprehensive understanding of the
relationships among students' knowledge state. Finally, through personalized
diagnostic enhancement, the framework integrates hierarchy constraint
perception features with existing models, improving the representation of both
individual and group characteristics. This approach enables precise inference
of students' knowledge state. Research shows that this framework not only
reasonably constrains changes in students' knowledge states to align with real

used in artificial intelligence(AI) based educational platforms. The goal is to
support the design of AI systems that can enhance learner conceptual
understanding of algebra by taking into account their current level of algebra
comprehension. The data set comprises 55 misconceptions about algebra, common
errors, and 220 diagnostic examples identified in previous peer-reviewed
studies. We provide an example application using a large language model,
observing a range of precision and recall scores depending on the topic and
experimental setup that reaches 83.9% when including educator feedback and
restricting it by topic. We found that topics such as ratios and proportions
prove as difficult for LLMs as they are for students. We included a human
assessment of LLMs results and feedback from five middle school math educators
on the clarity and occurrence of misconceptions in the dataset and the
potential use of AI in conjunction with the dataset. Most educators (80% or
more) indicated that they encounter these misconceptions among their students,
suggesting the relevance of the data set to teaching middle school algebra.
Despite varying familiarity with AI tools, four out of five educators expressed
interest in using the data set with AI to diagnose student misconceptions or

  automatischen Bewertung von Hausaufgaben","This study examines the AI-powered grading tool ""AI Grading Assistant"" by the
German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing
feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an
overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial
intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the
tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal
significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback
are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated.
The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False
claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the
implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these
deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models

The Parameters of Educability,"The educability model is a computational model that has been recently
proposed to describe the cognitive capability that makes humans unique among
existing biological species on Earth in being able to create advanced
civilizations. Educability is defined as a capability for acquiring and
applying knowledge. It is intended both to describe human capabilities and,
equally, as an aspirational description of what can be usefully realized by
machines. While the intention is to have a mathematically well-defined
computational model, in constructing an instance of the model there are a
number of decisions to make. We call these decisions {\it parameters}. In a
standard computer, two parameters are the memory capacity and clock rate. There
is no universally optimal choice for either one, or even for their ratio.
Similarly, in a standard machine learning system, two parameters are the
learning algorithm and the dataset used for training. Again, there are no
universally optimal choices known for either. An educable system has many more
parameters than either of these two kinds of system. This short paper discusses

"The AI Assessment Scale Revisited: A Framework for Educational
  Assessment","Recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have
created significant uncertainty in education, particularly in terms of
assessment practices. Against this backdrop, we present an updated version of
the AI Assessment Scale (AIAS), a framework with two fundamental purposes: to
facilitate open dialogue between educators and students about appropriate GenAI
use and to support educators in redesigning assessments in an era of expanding
AI capabilities.
  Grounded in social constructivist principles and designed with assessment
validity in mind, the AIAS provides a structured yet flexible approach that can
be adapted across different educational contexts. Building on implementation
feedback from global adoption across both the K-12 and higher education
contexts, this revision represents a significant change from the original AIAS.
Among these changes is a new visual guide that moves beyond the original

their self-efficacy using a scale developed based on Bandura's theory. PLS-SEM
analysis revealed that teachers' self-efficacy was low, primarily influenced by
emotional and physiological states and imaginary experiences related to AI
instruction. Mastery experiences had a lesser impact, and vicarious experiences
and verbal persuasion showed no significant effect. The study highlights the
need for a systemic approach to teacher professional development, considering
the limitations in teachers' AI expertise and social capital. Further research
is recommended to explore a socio-technical systems perspective for effective
AI teacher training.",2024-12-27,2024,2024-12,education

AI Agent for Education: von Neumann Multi-Agent System Framework,"The development of large language models has ushered in new paradigms for
education. This paper centers on the multi-Agent system in education and
proposes the von Neumann multi-Agent system framework. It breaks down each AI
Agent into four modules: control unit, logic unit, storage unit, and
input-output devices, defining four types of operations: task deconstruction,
self-reflection, memory processing, and tool invocation. Furthermore, it
introduces related technologies such as Chain-of-Thought, Reson+Act, and
Multi-Agent Debate associated with these four types of operations. The paper
also discusses the ability enhancement cycle of a multi-Agent system for
education, including the outer circulation for human learners to promote
knowledge construction and the inner circulation for LLM-based-Agents to
enhance swarm intelligence. Through collaboration and reflection, the
multi-Agent system can better facilitate human learners' learning and enhance
their teaching abilities in this process.",2024-12-30,2024,2024-12,education

"Efficient Multi-Task Inferencing with a Shared Backbone and Lightweight
  Task-Specific Adapters for Automatic Scoring","The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education requires
scalable and efficient frameworks that balance performance, adaptability, and
cost. This paper addresses these needs by proposing a shared backbone model
architecture enhanced with lightweight LoRA adapters for task-specific
fine-tuning, targeting the automated scoring of student responses across 27
mutually exclusive tasks. By achieving competitive performance (average QWK of
0.848 compared to 0.888 for fully fine-tuned models) while reducing GPU memory
consumption by 60% and inference latency by 40%, the framework demonstrates
significant efficiency gains. This approach aligns with the workshops' focus on
improving language models for educational tasks, creating responsible
innovations for cost-sensitive deployment, and supporting educators by
streamlining assessment workflows. The findings underscore the potential of
scalable AI to enhance learning outcomes while maintaining fairness and
transparency in automated scoring systems.",2024-12-30,2024,2024-12,education
