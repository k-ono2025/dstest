"Artificial Intelligence in Reverse Supply Chain Management: The State of
  the Art","Product take-back legislation forces manufacturers to bear the costs of
collection and disposal of products that have reached the end of their useful
lives. In order to reduce these costs, manufacturers can consider reuse,
remanufacturing and/or recycling of components as an alternative to disposal.
The implementation of such alternatives usually requires an appropriate reverse
supply chain management. With the concepts of reverse supply chain are gaining
popularity in practice, the use of artificial intelligence approaches in these
areas is also becoming popular. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to
give an overview of the recent publications concerning the application of
artificial intelligence techniques to reverse supply chain with emphasis on
certain types of product returns.",2010-12-18,2010,2010-12,manufacturing
"Machine-Part cell formation through visual decipherable clustering of
  Self Organizing Map","Machine-part cell formation is used in cellular manufacturing in order to
process a large variety, quality, lower work in process levels, reducing
manufacturing lead-time and customer response time while retaining flexibility
for new products. This paper presents a new and novel approach for obtaining
machine cells and part families. In the cellular manufacturing the fundamental
problem is the formation of part families and machine cells. The present paper
deals with the Self Organising Map (SOM) method an unsupervised learning
algorithm in Artificial Intelligence, and has been used as a visually
decipherable clustering tool of machine-part cell formation. The objective of
the paper is to cluster the binary machine-part matrix through visually
decipherable cluster of SOM color-coding and labelling via the SOM map nodes in
such a way that the part families are processed in that machine cells. The
Umatrix, component plane, principal component projection, scatter plot and
histogram of SOM have been reported in the present work for the successful
visualization of the machine-part cell formation. Computational result with the
proposed algorithm on a set of group technology problems available in the
literature is also presented. The proposed SOM approach produced solutions with
a grouping efficacy that is at least as good as any results earlier reported in
the literature and improved the grouping efficacy for 70% of the problems and
found immensely useful to both industry practitioners and researchers.",2011-05-06,2011,2011-05,manufacturing
Causal Discovery for Manufacturing Domains,"Yield and quality improvement is of paramount importance to any manufacturing
company. One of the ways of improving yield is through discovery of the root
causal factors affecting yield. We propose the use of data-driven interpretable
causal models to identify key factors affecting yield. We focus on factors that
are measured in different stages of production and testing in the manufacturing
cycle of a product. We apply causal structure learning techniques on real data
collected from this line. Specifically, the goal of this work is to learn
interpretable causal models from observational data produced by manufacturing
lines.
  Emphasis has been given to the interpretability of the models to make them
actionable in the field of manufacturing. We highlight the challenges presented
by assembly line data and propose ways to alleviate them.We also identify
unique characteristics of data originating from assembly lines and how to
leverage them in order to improve causal discovery. Standard evaluation
techniques for causal structure learning shows that the learned causal models
seem to closely represent the underlying latent causal relationship between
different factors in the production process. These results were also validated
by manufacturing domain experts who found them promising. This work
demonstrates how data mining and knowledge discovery can be used for root cause
analysis in the domain of manufacturing and connected industry.",2016-05-13,2016,2016-05,manufacturing
Scope for Machine Learning in Digital Manufacturing,"This provocation paper provides an overview of the underlying optimisation
problem in the emerging field of Digital Manufacturing. Initially, this paper
discusses how the notion of Digital Manufacturing is transforming from a term
describing a suite of software tools for the integration of production and
design functions towards a more general concept incorporating computerised
manufacturing and supply chain processes, as well as information collection and
utilisation across the product life cycle. On this basis, we use the example of
one such manufacturing process, Additive Manufacturing, to identify an
integrated multi-objective optimisation problem underlying Digital
Manufacturing. Forming an opportunity for a concurrent application of data
science and optimisation, a set of challenges arising from this problem is
outlined.",2016-09-19,2016,2016-09,manufacturing
Closed-Loop Policies for Operational Tests of Safety-Critical Systems,"Manufacturers of safety-critical systems must make the case that their
product is sufficiently safe for public deployment. Much of this case often
relies upon critical event outcomes from real-world testing, requiring
manufacturers to be strategic about how they allocate testing resources in
order to maximize their chances of demonstrating system safety. This work
frames the partially observable and belief-dependent problem of test scheduling
as a Markov decision process, which can be solved efficiently to yield
closed-loop manufacturer testing policies. By solving for policies over a wide
range of problem formulations, we are able to provide high-level guidance for
manufacturers and regulators on issues relating to the testing of
safety-critical systems. This guidance spans an array of topics, including
circumstances under which manufacturers should continue testing despite
observed incidents, when manufacturers should test aggressively, and when
regulators should increase or reduce the real-world testing requirements for an
autonomous vehicle.",2017-07-25,2017,2017-07,manufacturing
Automated Process Planning for Hybrid Manufacturing,"Hybrid manufacturing (HM) technologies combine additive and subtractive
manufacturing (AM/SM) capabilities, leveraging AM's strengths in fabricating
complex geometries and SM's precision and quality to produce finished parts. We
present a systematic approach to automated computer-aided process planning
(CAPP) for HM that can identify non-trivial, qualitatively distinct, and
cost-optimal combinations of AM/SM modalities. A multimodal HM process plan is
represented by a finite Boolean expression of AM and SM manufacturing
primitives, such that the expression evaluates to an 'as-manufactured'
artifact. We show that primitives that respect spatial constraints such as
accessibility and collision avoidance may be constructed by solving inverse
configuration space problems on the 'as-designed' artifact and manufacturing
instruments. The primitives generate a finite Boolean algebra (FBA) that
enumerates the entire search space for planning. The FBA's canonical
intersection terms (i.e., 'atoms') provide the complete domain decomposition to
reframe manufacturability analysis and process planning into purely symbolic
reasoning, once a subcollection of atoms is found to be interchangeable with
the design target. The approach subsumes unimodal (all-AM or all-SM) process
planning as special cases. We demonstrate the practical potency of our
framework and its computational efficiency when applied to process planning of
complex 3D parts with dramatically different AM and SM instruments.",2018-05-18,2018,2018-05,manufacturing
An Online RFID Localization in the Manufacturing Shopfloor,"{Radio Frequency Identification technology has gained popularity for cheap
and easy deployment. In the realm of manufacturing shopfloor, it can be used to
track the location of manufacturing objects to achieve better efficiency. The
underlying challenge of localization lies in the non-stationary characteristics
of manufacturing shopfloor which calls for an adaptive life-long learning
strategy in order to arrive at accurate localization results. This paper
presents an evolving model based on a novel evolving intelligent system, namely
evolving Type-2 Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (eT2QFNN), which features an
interval type-2 quantum fuzzy set with uncertain jump positions. The quantum
fuzzy set possesses a graded membership degree which enables better
identification of overlaps between classes. The eT2QFNN works fully in the
evolving mode where all parameters including the number of rules are
automatically adjusted and generated on the fly. The parameter adjustment
scenario relies on decoupled extended Kalman filter method. Our numerical study
shows that eT2QFNN is able to deliver comparable accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.",2018-05-20,2018,2018-05,manufacturing
Situation Calculus for Synthesis of Manufacturing Controllers,"Manufacturing is transitioning from a mass production model to a
manufacturing as a service model in which manufacturing facilities 'bid' to
produce products. To decide whether to bid for a complex, previously unseen
product, a manufacturing facility must be able to synthesize, 'on the fly', a
process plan controller that delegates abstract manufacturing tasks in the
supplied process recipe to the appropriate manufacturing resources, e.g., CNC
machines, robots etc. Previous work in applying AI behaviour composition to
synthesize process plan controllers has considered only finite state ad-hoc
representations. Here, we study the problem in the relational setting of the
Situation Calculus. By taking advantage of recent work on abstraction in the
Situation Calculus, process recipes and available resources are represented by
ConGolog programs over, respectively, an abstract and a concrete action theory.
This allows us to capture the problem in a formal, general framework, and show
decidability for the case of bounded action theories. We also provide
techniques for actually synthesizing the controller.",2018-07-12,2018,2018-07,manufacturing
A General End-to-end Diagnosis Framework for Manufacturing Systems,"The manufacturing sector is envisioned to be heavily influenced by artificial
intelligence-based technologies with the extraordinary increases in
computational power and data volumes. A central challenge in manufacturing
sector lies in the requirement of a general framework to ensure satisfied
diagnosis and monitoring performances in different manufacturing applications.
Here we propose a general data-driven, end-to-end framework for the monitoring
of manufacturing systems. This framework, derived from deep learning
techniques, evaluates fused sensory measurements to detect and even predict
faults and wearing conditions. This work exploits the predictive power of deep
learning to automatically extract hidden degradation features from noisy,
time-course data. We have experimented the proposed framework on ten
representative datasets drawn from a wide variety of manufacturing
applications. Results reveal that the framework performs well in examined
benchmark applications and can be applied in diverse contexts, indicating its
potential use as a critical corner stone in smart manufacturing.",2018-12-17,2018,2018-12,manufacturing
"A 20-Year Community Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence Research in the
  US","Decades of research in artificial intelligence (AI) have produced formidable
technologies that are providing immense benefit to industry, government, and
society. AI systems can now translate across multiple languages, identify
objects in images and video, streamline manufacturing processes, and control

industry that is projected to quadruple in three years, but has also exposed
the need to make AI systems fair, explainable, trustworthy, and secure. Future
AI systems will rightfully be expected to reason effectively about the world in
which they (and people) operate, handling complex tasks and responsibilities
effectively and ethically, engaging in meaningful communication, and improving

Manufacturing Dispatching using Reinforcement and Transfer Learning,"Efficient dispatching rule in manufacturing industry is key to ensure product
on-time delivery and minimum past-due and inventory cost. Manufacturing,
especially in the developed world, is moving towards on-demand manufacturing
meaning a high mix, low volume product mix. This requires efficient dispatching
that can work in dynamic and stochastic environments, meaning it allows for
quick response to new orders received and can work over a disparate set of shop
floor settings. In this paper we address this problem of dispatching in
manufacturing. Using reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a new design to
formulate the shop floor state as a 2-D matrix, incorporate job slack time into
state representation, and design lateness and tardiness rewards function for
dispatching purpose. However, maintaining a separate RL model for each
production line on a manufacturing shop floor is costly and often infeasible.
To address this, we enhance our deep RL model with an approach for dispatching
policy transfer. This increases policy generalization and saves time and cost
for model training and data collection. Experiments show that: (1) our approach
performs the best in terms of total discounted reward and average lateness,
tardiness, (2) the proposed policy transfer approach reduces training time and
increases policy generalization.",2019-10-04,2019,2019-10,manufacturing
Recurrent neural network approach for cyclic job shop scheduling problem,"While cyclic scheduling is involved in numerous real-world applications,
solving the derived problem is still of exponential complexity. This paper
focuses specifically on modelling the manufacturing application as a cyclic job
shop problem and we have developed an efficient neural network approach to
minimise the cycle time of a schedule. Our approach introduces an interesting
model for a manufacturing production, and it is also very efficient, adaptive
and flexible enough to work with other techniques. Experimental results
validated the approach and confirmed our hypotheses about the system model and
the efficiency of neural networks for such a class of problems.",2019-10-21,2019,2019-10,manufacturing
One-Shot Recognition of Manufacturing Defects in Steel Surfaces,"Quality control is an essential process in manufacturing to make the product
defect-free as well as to meet customer needs. The automation of this process
is important to maintain high quality along with the high manufacturing
throughput. With recent developments in deep learning and computer vision
technologies, it has become possible to detect various features from the images
with near-human accuracy. However, many of these approaches are data intensive.
Training and deployment of such a system on manufacturing floors may become
expensive and time-consuming. The need for large amounts of training data is
one of the limitations of the applicability of these approaches in real-world
manufacturing systems. In this work, we propose the application of a Siamese
convolutional neural network to do one-shot recognition for such a task. Our
results demonstrate how one-shot learning can be used in quality control of
steel by identification of defects on the steel surface. This method can
significantly reduce the requirements of training data and can also be run in
real-time.",2020-05-12,2020,2020-05,manufacturing

Using Semantic Web Services for AI-Based Research in Industry 4.0,"The transition to Industry 4.0 requires smart manufacturing systems that are
easily configurable and provide a high level of flexibility during
manufacturing in order to achieve mass customization or to support cloud
manufacturing. To realize this, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) combined with
Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods find their way into manufacturing shop
floors. For using AI methods in the context of Industry 4.0, semantic web
services are indispensable to provide a reasonable abstraction of the
underlying manufacturing capabilities. In this paper, we present semantic web
services for AI-based research in Industry 4.0. Therefore, we developed more
than 300 semantic web services for a physical simulation factory based on Web
Ontology Language for Web Services (OWL-S) and Web Service Modeling Ontology
(WSMO) and linked them to an already existing domain ontology for intelligent
manufacturing control. Suitable for the requirements of CPS environments, our
pre- and postconditions are verified in near real-time by invoking other
semantic web services in contrast to complex reasoning within the knowledge

"Explainable Artificial Intelligence Based Fault Diagnosis and Insight
  Harvesting for Steel Plates Manufacturing","With the advent of Industry 4.0, Data Science and Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) has received considerable intrest in recent literature.
However, the entry threshold into XAI, in terms of computer coding and the
requisite mathematical apparatus, is really high. For fault diagnosis of steel
plates, this work reports on a methodology of incorporating XAI based insights
into the Data Science process of development of high precision classifier.
Using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and notion of medoids,
insights from XAI tools viz. Ceteris Peribus profiles, Partial Dependence and
Breakdown profiles have been harvested. Additionally, insights in the form of
IF-THEN rules have also been extracted from an optimized Random Forest and
Association Rule Mining. Incorporating all the insights into a single ensemble
classifier, a 10 fold cross validated performance of 94% has been achieved. In
sum total, this work makes three main contributions viz.: methodology based
upon utilization of medoids and SMOTE, of gleaning insights and incorporating
into model development process. Secondly the insights themselves are
contribution, as they benefit the human experts of steel manufacturing
industry, and thirdly a high precision fault diagnosis classifier has been
developed.",2020-08-10,2020,2020-08,manufacturing

"Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Manufacturing Cost Estimation
  and Machining Feature Visualization","Studies on manufacturing cost prediction based on deep learning have begun in
recent years, but the cost prediction rationale cannot be explained because the
models are still used as a black box. This study aims to propose a
manufacturing cost prediction process for 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models
using explainable artificial intelligence. The proposed process can visualize
the machining features of the 3D CAD model that are influencing the increase in
manufacturing costs. The proposed process consists of (1) data collection and
pre-processing, (2) 3D deep learning architecture exploration, and (3)
visualization to explain the prediction results. The proposed deep learning
model shows high predictability of manufacturing cost for the computer
numerical control (CNC) machined parts. In particular, using 3D
gradient-weighted class activation mapping proves that the proposed model not
only can detect the CNC machining features but also can differentiate the
machining difficulty for the same feature. Using the proposed process, we can
provide a design guidance to engineering designers in reducing manufacturing
costs during the conceptual design phase. We can also provide real-time

Curiosity Based Reinforcement Learning on Robot Manufacturing Cell,"This paper introduces a novel combination of scheduling control on a flexible
robot manufacturing cell with curiosity based reinforcement learning.
Reinforcement learning has proved to be highly successful in solving tasks like
robotics and scheduling. But this requires hand tuning of rewards in problem
domains like robotics and scheduling even where the solution is not obvious. To
this end, we apply a curiosity based reinforcement learning, using intrinsic
motivation as a form of reward, on a flexible robot manufacturing cell to
alleviate this problem. Further, the learning agents are embedded into the
transportation robots to enable a generalized learning solution that can be
applied to a variety of environments. In the first approach, the curiosity
based reinforcement learning is applied to a simple structured robot
manufacturing cell. And in the second approach, the same algorithm is applied
to a graph structured robot manufacturing cell. Results from the experiments
show that the agents are able to solve both the environments with the ability
to transfer the curiosity module directly from one environment to another. We
conclude that curiosity based learning on scheduling tasks provide a viable
alternative to the reward shaped reinforcement learning traditionally used.",2020-11-17,2020,2020-11,manufacturing
"A Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Multi-Criteria Decision Support
  System for Textile Manufacturing Process Optimization","Textile manufacturing is a typical traditional industry involving high
complexity in interconnected processes with limited capacity on the application

this issue, the present paper proposes a decision support system that combines
the intelligent data-based random forest (RF) models and a human knowledge
based analytical hierarchical process (AHP) multi-criteria structure in
accordance to the objective and the subjective factors of the textile
manufacturing process. More importantly, the textile manufacturing process is
described as the Markov decision process (MDP) paradigm, and a deep
reinforcement learning scheme, the Deep Q-networks (DQN), is employed to
optimize it. The effectiveness of this system has been validated in a case
study of optimizing a textile ozonation process, showing that it can better
master the challenging decision-making tasks in textile manufacturing
processes.",2020-12-29,2020,2020-12,manufacturing
"Reliability Analysis of Artificial Intelligence Systems Using Recurrent
  Events Data from Autonomous Vehicles","Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have become increasingly common and the
trend will continue. Examples of AI systems include autonomous vehicles (AV),
computer vision, natural language processing, and AI medical experts. To allow
for safe and effective deployment of AI systems, the reliability of such
systems needs to be assessed. Traditionally, reliability assessment is based on
reliability test data and the subsequent statistical modeling and analysis. The
availability of reliability data for AI systems, however, is limited because
such data are typically sensitive and proprietary. The California Department of
Motor Vehicles (DMV) oversees and regulates an AV testing program, in which
many AV manufacturers are conducting AV road tests. Manufacturers participating
in the program are required to report recurrent disengagement events to
California DMV. This information is being made available to the public. In this
paper, we use recurrent disengagement events as a representation of the
reliability of the AI system in AV, and propose a statistical framework for
modeling and analyzing the recurrent events data from AV driving tests. We use
traditional parametric models in software reliability and propose a new
nonparametric model based on monotonic splines to describe the event process.
We develop inference procedures for selecting the best models, quantifying
uncertainty, and testing heterogeneity in the event process. We then analyze
the recurrent events data from four AV manufacturers, and make inferences on
the reliability of the AI systems in AV. We also describe how the proposed
analysis can be applied to assess the reliability of other AI systems.",2021-02-02,2021,2021-02,manufacturing
Actionable Cognitive Twins for Decision Making in Manufacturing,"Actionable Cognitive Twins are the next generation Digital Twins enhanced
with cognitive capabilities through a knowledge graph and artificial
intelligence models that provide insights and decision-making options to the
users. The knowledge graph describes the domain-specific knowledge regarding
entities and interrelationships related to a manufacturing setting. It also
contains information on possible decision-making options that can assist
decision-makers, such as planners or logisticians. In this paper, we propose a
knowledge graph modeling approach to construct actionable cognitive twins for
capturing specific knowledge related to demand forecasting and production
planning in a manufacturing plant. The knowledge graph provides semantic
descriptions and contextualization of the production lines and processes,
including data identification and simulation or artificial intelligence
algorithms and forecasts used to support them. Such semantics provide ground
for inferencing, relating different knowledge types: creative, deductive,
definitional, and inductive. To develop the knowledge graph models for
describing the use case completely, systems thinking approach is proposed to
design and verify the ontology, develop a knowledge graph and build an
actionable cognitive twin. Finally, we evaluate our approach in two use cases

"The Role of Time and Data: Online Conformance Checking in the
  Manufacturing Domain","Process mining has matured as analysis instrument for process-oriented data
in recent years. Manufacturing is a challenging domain that craves for
process-oriented technologies to address digitalization challenges. We found
that process mining creates high expectations, but its implementation and usage
by manufacturing experts such as process supervisors and shopfloor workers
remain unclear to a certain extent. Reason (1) is that even though
manufacturing allows for well-structured processes, the actual workflow is
rarely captured in a process model. Even if a model is available, a software
for orchestrating and logging the execution is often missing. Reason (2) refers
to the work reality in manufacturing: a process instance is started by a
shopfloor worker who then turns to work on other things. Hence continuous
monitoring of the process instances does not happen, i.e., process monitoring
is merely a secondary task, and the shopfloor worker can only react to
problems/errors that have already occurred. (1) and (2) motivate the goals of
this study that is driven by Technical Action Research (TAR). Based on the
experimental artifact TIDATE -- a lightweight process execution and mining
framework -- it is studied how the correct execution of process instances can
be ensured and how a data set suitable for process mining can be generated at
run time in a real-world setting. Secondly, it is investigated whether and how
process mining supports domain experts during process monitoring as a secondary

"XAI-KG: knowledge graph to support XAI and decision-making in
  manufacturing","The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence requires accurate
forecasts and means to understand the reasoning of artificial intelligence
models behind such a forecast. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims
to provide cues for why a model issued a certain prediction. Such cues are of
utmost importance to decision-making since they provide insights on the
features that influenced most certain forecasts and let the user decide if the
forecast can be trusted. Though many techniques were developed to explain
black-box models, little research was done on assessing the quality of those
explanations and their influence on decision-making. We propose an ontology and
knowledge graph to support collecting feedback regarding forecasts, forecast
explanations, recommended decision-making options, and user actions. This way,
we provide means to improve forecasting models, explanations, and

Monte Carlo Tree Search for high precision manufacturing,"Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has shown its strength for a lot of
deterministic and stochastic examples, but literature lacks reports of

"TinyDefectNet: Highly Compact Deep Neural Network Architecture for
  High-Throughput Manufacturing Visual Quality Inspection","A critical aspect in the manufacturing process is the visual quality
inspection of manufactured components for defects and flaws. Human-only visual
inspection can be very time-consuming and laborious, and is a significant
bottleneck especially for high-throughput manufacturing scenarios. Given
significant advances in the field of deep learning, automated visual quality
inspection can lead to highly efficient and reliable detection of defects and
flaws during the manufacturing process. However, deep learning-driven visual
inspection methods often necessitate significant computational resources, thus
limiting throughput and act as a bottleneck to widespread adoption for enabling
smart factories. In this study, we investigated the utilization of a

the EU funded Teaming.AI project, we identified the monitoring of teaming
aspects in human-AI collaboration, the runtime monitoring and validation of
ethical policies, and the support for experimentation with data and machine

"Accelerating Part-Scale Simulation in Liquid Metal Jet Additive
  Manufacturing via Operator Learning","Predicting part quality for additive manufacturing (AM) processes requires
high-fidelity numerical simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs)
governing process multiphysics on a scale of minimum manufacturable features.
This makes part-scale predictions computationally demanding, especially when
they require many small-scale simulations. We consider drop-on-demand liquid
metal jetting (LMJ) as an illustrative example of such computational
complexity. A model describing droplet coalescence for LMJ may include coupled
incompressible fluid flow, heat transfer, and phase change equations.
Numerically solving these equations becomes prohibitively expensive when
simulating the build process for a full part consisting of thousands to
millions of droplets. Reduced-order models (ROMs) based on neural networks (NN)
or k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithms have been built to replace the original
physics-based solver and are computationally tractable for part-level
simulations. However, their quick inference capabilities often come at the
expense of accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. We apply an operator
learning (OL) approach to learn a mapping between initial and final states of
the droplet coalescence process for enabling rapid and accurate part-scale
build simulation. Preliminary results suggest that OL requires
order-of-magnitude fewer data points than a kNN approach and is generalizable

An Ontology for Defect Detection in Metal Additive Manufacturing,"A key challenge for Industry 4.0 applications is to develop control systems
for automated manufacturing services that are capable of addressing both data
integration and semantic interoperability issues, as well as monitoring and
decision making tasks. To address such an issue in advanced manufacturing
systems, principled knowledge representation approaches based on formal
ontologies have been proposed as a foundation to information management and
maintenance in presence of heterogeneous data sources. In addition, ontologies
provide reasoning and querying capabilities to aid domain experts and end users

"Image-based Artificial Intelligence empowered surrogate model and shape
  morpher for real-time blank shape optimisation in the hot stamping process","As the complexity of modern manufacturing technologies increases, traditional
trial-and-error design, which requires iterative and expensive simulations,
becomes unreliable and time-consuming. This difficulty is especially
significant for the design of hot-stamped safety-critical components, such as
ultra-high-strength-steel (UHSS) B-pillars. To reduce design costs and ensure
manufacturability, scalar-based Artificial-Intelligence-empowered surrogate
modelling (SAISM) has been investigated and implemented, which can allow
real-time manufacturability-constrained structural design optimisation.
However, SAISM suffers from low accuracy and generalisability, and usually
requires a high volume of training samples. To solve this problem, an
image-based Artificial-intelligence-empowered surrogate modelling (IAISM)
approach is developed in this research, in combination with an
auto-decoder-based blank shape generator. The IAISM, which is based on a
Mask-Res-SE-U-Net architecture, is trained to predict the full thinning field
of the as-formed component given an arbitrary blank shape. Excellent prediction
performance of IAISM is achieved with only 256 training samples, which
indicates the small-data learning nature of engineering AI tasks using
structured data representations. The trained auto-decoder, trained
Mask-Res-SE-U-Net, and Adam optimiser are integrated to conduct blank
optimisation by modifying the latent vector. The optimiser can rapidly find
blank shapes that satisfy manufacturability criteria. As a high-accuracy and
generalisable surrogate modelling and optimisation tool, the proposed pipeline

cobots' onboard sensors and utilisation properties from crowdsourced
commonsense knowledge available at public knowledge bases. Such flexible
knowledge representation based on property decomposition allows for
data-efficient representation learning of typically highly specialist or
specific manufacturing artefacts. In such a setting, traditional data-driven

training data scarcity. This allows for comprehensibility of an AI agent's
acquired knowledge by the human collaborator thus contributing to

BAs and BIA is the most crucial step in connecting manufacturing resources.
With the support of TA and DA, BIA will finalize the distribution of orders,

"Hybrid Gaussian Process Regression with Temporal Feature Extraction for
  Partially Interpretable Remaining Useful Life Interval Prediction in
  Aeroengine Prognostics","The estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a pivotal role in
intelligent manufacturing systems and Industry 4.0 technologies. While recent
advancements have improved RUL prediction, many models still face
interpretability and compelling uncertainty modeling challenges. This paper
introduces a modified Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model for RUL interval
prediction, tailored for the complexities of manufacturing process development.
The modified GPR predicts confidence intervals by learning from historical data
and addresses uncertainty modeling in a more structured way. The approach
effectively captures intricate time-series patterns and dynamic behaviors
inherent in modern manufacturing systems by coupling GPR with deep adaptive
learning-enhanced AI process models. Moreover, the model evaluates feature
significance to ensure more transparent decision-making, which is crucial for
optimizing manufacturing processes. This comprehensive approach supports more
accurate RUL predictions and provides transparent, interpretable insights into
uncertainty, contributing to robust process development and management.",2024-11-19,2024,2024-11,manufacturing
"Regulator-Manufacturer AI Agents Modeling: Mathematical Feedback-Driven
  Multi-Agent LLM Framework","The increasing complexity of regulatory updates from global authorities
presents significant challenges for medical device manufacturers, necessitating
agile strategies to sustain compliance and maintain market access.
Concurrently, regulatory bodies must effectively monitor manufacturers'
responses and develop strategic surveillance plans. This study employs a
multi-agent modeling approach, enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), to
simulate regulatory dynamics and examine the adaptive behaviors of key actors,
including regulatory bodies, manufacturers, and competitors. These agents
operate within a simulated environment governed by regulatory flow theory,
capturing the impacts of regulatory changes on compliance decisions, market
adaptation, and innovation strategies. Our findings illuminate the influence of
regulatory shifts on industry behaviour and identify strategic opportunities
for improving regulatory practices, optimizing compliance, and fostering
innovation. By leveraging the integration of multi-agent systems and LLMs, this
research provides a novel perspective and offers actionable insights for
stakeholders navigating the evolving regulatory landscape of the medical device
industry.",2024-11-22,2024,2024-11,manufacturing
"Pivoting B2B platform business models: From platform experimentation to
  multi-platform integration to ecosystem envelopment","The landscape of digital servitization in the manufacturing sector is
evolving, marked by a strategic shift from traditional product-centric to
platform business models (BMs). Manufacturing firms often employ a blend of
approaches to develop business-to-business (B2B) platforms, leading to
significant reconfigurations in their BMs. However, they frequently encounter
failures in their B2B platform development initiatives, leading them to abandon
initial efforts and pivot to alternative platform strategies. Therefore, this
study, through an in-depth case study of a manufacturer in the energy sector,
articulates a three-phase pivoting framework for B2B platform BMs, including
platform development and platform strategy. Initially, the manufacturer focused
on asset-based product sales supplemented by asset maintenance services and
followed an emergent platformization strategy characterized by the rise of
multiple, independent B2B platforms catering to diverse functions. Next,
focusing on the imposed customer journey strategy, the firm shifted towards a
strategic multi-platform integration into an all-encompassing platform
supported by artificial intelligence (AI), signaling a maturation of the
platform BM to combine a wide range of services into an
energy-performance-based contract. Finally, the last step of the firm's
platform BM evolution consisted of a deliberate platform strategy open to
external stakeholders and enveloping its data-driven offerings within a broader
platform ecosystem. This article advances B2B platform BMs and digital
servitization literature, highlighting the efficacy of a progressive approach
and strategic pivoting.",2024-12-27,2024,2024-12,manufacturing
