An architecture for the evaluation of intelligent systems,"One of the main research areas in Artificial Intelligence is the coding of
agents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This
means that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were
created for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer
to the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide
whether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its
intelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way.
The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the
execution of several environments, including those which are generated
randomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once
the interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter
will measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and
rewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a
result we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible
environment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to
determine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests,
the interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really
useful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated
environment will serve that purpose.",2011-02-03,2011,2011-02,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0714v1

"Artificial Intelligence Framework for Simulating Clinical
  Decision-Making: A Markov Decision Process Approach","In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the
growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that
often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose
optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a
general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence
(AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential
functions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare
policies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial
intelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines
Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical
data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential
decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic
interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in
partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)
by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an
online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real
patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily
outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service
models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a
30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further
enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly
half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation
framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain
environments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of
research and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized
medicine.",2013-01-10,2013,2013-01,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2158v1
On Stable Multi-Agent Behavior in Face of Uncertainty,"A stable joint plan should guarantee the achievement of a designer's goal in

representation, verification and synthesis of stable joint plans.",2013-02-06,2013,2013-02,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1570v1

Ergo: A Graphical Environment for Constructing Bayesian,"We describe an environment that considerably simplifies the process of
generating Bayesian belief networks. The system has been implemented on readily
available, inexpensive hardware, and provides clarity and high performance. We
present an introduction to Bayesian belief networks, discuss algorithms for
inference with these networks, and delineate the classes of problems that can
be solved with this paradigm. We then describe the hardware and software that

A Probabilistic Reasoning Environment,"A framework is presented for a computational theory of probabilistic
argument. The Probabilistic Reasoning Environment encodes knowledge at three
levels. At the deepest level are a set of schemata encoding the system's domain
knowledge. This knowledge is used to build a set of second-level arguments,
which are structured for efficient recapture of the knowledge used to construct
them. Finally, at the top level is a Bayesian network constructed from the
arguments. The system is designed to facilitate not just propagation of beliefs
and assimilation of evidence, but also the dynamic process of constructing a
belief network, evaluating its adequacy, and revising it when necessary.",2013-03-27,2013,2013-03,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1130v1
"Enaction-Based Artificial Intelligence: Toward Coevolution with Humans
  in the Loop","This article deals with the links between the enaction paradigm and
artificial intelligence. Enaction is considered a metaphor for artificial
intelligence, as a number of the notions which it deals with are deemed
incompatible with the phenomenal field of the virtual. After explaining this
stance, we shall review previous works regarding this issue in terms of
artifical life and robotics. We shall focus on the lack of recognition of
co-evolution at the heart of these approaches. We propose to explicitly
integrate the evolution of the environment into our approach in order to refine
the ontogenesis of the artificial system, and to compare it with the enaction
paradigm. The growing complexity of the ontogenetic mechanisms to be activated
can therefore be compensated by an interactive guidance system emanating from
the environment. This proposition does not however resolve that of the
relevance of the meaning created by the machine (sense-making). Such
reflections lead us to integrate human interaction into this environment in
order to construct relevant meaning in terms of participative artificial
intelligence. This raises a number of questions with regards to setting up an
enactive interaction. The article concludes by exploring a number of issues,
thereby enabling us to associate current approaches with the principles of
morphogenesis, guidance, the phenomenology of interactions and the use of
minimal enactive interfaces in setting up experiments which will deal with the
problem of artificial intelligence in a variety of enaction-based ways.",2014-02-26,2014,2014-02,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6663v1

"Hybrid Systems Knowledge Representation Using Modelling Environment
  System Techniques Artificial Intelligence","Knowledge-based or Artificial Intelligence techniques are used increasingly
as alternatives to more classical techniques to model ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS.
Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in environmental modelling has increased
with recognition of its potential. In this paper we examine the DIFFERENT
TECHNIQUES of Artificial intelligence with profound examples of human
perception, learning and reasoning to solve complex problems. However with the
increase of complexity better methods are required. Keeping in view of the
above some researchers introduced the idea of hybrid mechanism in which two or
more methods can be combined which seems to be a positive effort for creating a

"Quantifying Morphological Computation based on an Information
  Decomposition of the Sensorimotor Loop","The question how an agent is affected by its embodiment has attracted growing
attention in recent years. A new field of artificial intelligence has emerged,
which is based on the idea that intelligence cannot be understood without
taking into account embodiment. We believe that a formal approach to
quantifying the embodiment's effect on the agent's behaviour is beneficial to
the fields of artificial life and artificial intelligence. The contribution of
an agent's body and environment to its behaviour is also known as morphological
computation. Therefore, in this work, we propose a quantification of
morphological computation, which is based on an information decomposition of
the sensorimotor loop into shared, unique and synergistic information. In
numerical simulation based on a formal representation of the sensorimotor loop,
we show that the unique information of the body and environment is a good
measure for morphological computation. The results are compared to our
previously derived quantification of morphological computation.",2015-03-17,2015,2015-03,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05113v1

several thousands candidate architectures. A variant of fitted Q iteration,
based on Advantage values instead of Q values, is also explored. The results
show that GRU performs significantly better than LSTM and MUT1 for most of the

Category Theoretic Analysis of Photon-based Decision Making,"Decision making is a vital function in this age of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, yet its physical realization and theoretical
fundamentals are still not completely understood. In our former study, we
demonstrated that single-photons can be used to make decisions in uncertain,
dynamically changing environments. The two-armed bandit problem was
successfully solved using the dual probabilistic and particle attributes of
single photons. In this study, we present a category theoretic modeling and
analysis of single-photon-based decision making, including a quantitative
analysis that is in agreement with the experimental results. A category
theoretic model reveals the complex interdependencies of subject matter
entities in a simplified manner, even in dynamically changing environments. In
particular, the octahedral and braid structures in triangulated categories
provide a better understanding and quantitative metrics of the underlying
mechanisms of a single-photon decision maker. This study provides both insight
and a foundation for analyzing more complex and uncertain problems, to further
machine learning and artificial intelligence.",2016-02-26,2016,2016-02,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08199v3

Minimally Naturalistic Artificial Intelligence,"The rapid advancement of machine learning techniques has re-energized
research into general artificial intelligence. While the idea of
domain-agnostic meta-learning is appealing, this emerging field must come to
terms with its relationship to human cognition and the statistics and structure
of the tasks humans perform. The position of this article is that only by
aligning our agents' abilities and environments with those of humans do we
stand a chance at developing general artificial intelligence (GAI). A broad
reading of the famous 'No Free Lunch' theorem is that there is no universally
optimal inductive bias or, equivalently, bias-free learning is impossible. This
follows from the fact that there are an infinite number of ways to extrapolate
data, any of which might be the one used by the data generating environment; an
inductive bias prefers some of these extrapolations to others, which lowers
performance in environments using these adversarial extrapolations. We may
posit that the optimal GAI is the one that maximally exploits the statistics of
its environment to create its inductive bias; accepting the fact that this
agent is guaranteed to be extremely sub-optimal for some alternative
environments. This trade-off appears benign when thinking about the environment
as being the physical universe, as performance on any fictive universe is
obviously irrelevant. But, we should expect a sharper inductive bias if we
further constrain our environment. Indeed, we implicitly do so by defining GAI
in terms of accomplishing that humans consider useful. One common version of
this is need the for 'common-sense reasoning', which implicitly appeals to the
statistics of physical universe as perceived by humans.",2017-01-14,2017,2017-01,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03868v1
Don't Fear the Reaper: Refuting Bostrom's Superintelligence Argument,"In recent years prominent intellectuals have raised ethical concerns about
the consequences of artificial intelligence. One concern is that an autonomous
agent might modify itself to become ""superintelligent"" and, in supremely
effective pursuit of poorly specified goals, destroy all of humanity. This
paper considers and rejects the possibility of this outcome. We argue that this
scenario depends on an agent's ability to rapidly improve its ability to
predict its environment through self-modification. Using a Bayesian model of a
reasoning agent, we show that there are important limitations to how an agent
may improve its predictive ability through self-modification alone. We conclude
that concern about this artificial intelligence outcome is misplaced and better
directed at policy questions around data access and storage.",2017-02-27,2017,2017-02,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08495v2

collaborative research in this area by enabling different research groups to

Towards a Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Tower Line Wars,"There have been numerous breakthroughs with reinforcement learning in the
recent years, perhaps most notably on Deep Reinforcement Learning successfully

anticipation that Deep Reinforcement Learning will play a major role when the
first AI masters the complicated game plays needed to beat a professional
Real-Time Strategy game player. For this to be possible, there needs to be a
game environment that targets and fosters AI research, and specifically Deep
Reinforcement Learning. Some game environments already exist, however, these
are either overly simplistic such as Atari 2600 or complex such as Starcraft II
from Blizzard Entertainment. We propose a game environment in between Atari
2600 and Starcraft II, particularly targeting Deep Reinforcement Learning
algorithm research. The environment is a variant of Tower Line Wars from
Warcraft III, Blizzard Entertainment. Further, as a proof of concept that the
environment can harbor Deep Reinforcement algorithms, we propose and apply a
Deep Q-Reinforcement architecture. The architecture simplifies the state space
so that it is applicable to Q-learning, and in turn improves performance
compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments show that the
proposed architecture can learn to play the environment well, and score 33%
better than standard Deep Q-learning which in turn proves the usefulness of the

"An Actor-Critic-Attention Mechanism for Deep Reinforcement Learning in
  Multi-view Environments","In reinforcement learning algorithms, leveraging multiple views of the
environment can improve the learning of complicated policies. In multi-view
environments, due to the fact that the views may frequently suffer from partial
observability, their level of importance are often different. In this paper, we
propose a deep reinforcement learning method and an attention mechanism in a
multi-view environment. Each view can provide various representative
information about the environment. Through our attention mechanism, our method
generates a single feature representation of environment given its multiple

want AI systems that can model and understand their environment, we need

worthy challenge for deep learning and artificial intelligence methodologies to
assist firefighters with scene comprehension in maintaining their situational

in live fire environments. As a proof of concept, we imitate structural fire in
a gaming engine called Unreal Engine which enables the interaction of the agent

based on a set of rewards and penalties as per its actions on the environment.
We exploit experience replay to accelerate the learning process and augment the
learning of the agent with human-derived experiences. The agent trained under

  Artificial Intelligence: Understanding Human Behavior in Hazardous
  Environments","This paper focuses on the crucial task of addressing the evacuation of
hazardous places, which holds great importance for coordinators, event hosts,
and authorities. To facilitate the development of effective solutions, the
paper employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS), to construct a simulation model for evacuation. NetLogo is
selected as the simulation tool of choice due to its ability to provide a
comprehensive understanding of human behaviour in distressing situations within
hazardous environments. The primary objective of this paper is to enhance our
comprehension of how individuals react and respond during such distressing
situations. By leveraging AI and MAS, the simulation model aims to capture the
complex dynamics of evacuation scenarios, enabling policymakers and emergency
planners to make informed decisions and implement more efficient and effective
evacuation strategies. This paper endeavours to contribute to the advancement
of evacuation planning and ultimately improve the safety and well-being of
individuals in hazardous places",2023-06-11,2023,2023-06,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09485v1
"Adaptive User-centered Neuro-symbolic Learning for Multimodal
  Interaction with Autonomous Systems","Recent advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have enabled
autonomous systems to perceive and comprehend objects and their environments in
a perceptual subsymbolic manner. These systems can now perform object
detection, sensor data fusion, and language understanding tasks. However, there
is a growing need to enhance these systems to understand objects and their
environments more conceptually and symbolically. It is essential to consider
both the explicit teaching provided by humans (e.g., describing a situation or
explaining how to act) and the implicit teaching obtained by observing human
behavior (e.g., through the system's sensors) to achieve this level of powerful
artificial intelligence. Thus, the system must be designed with multimodal
input and output capabilities to support implicit and explicit interaction
models. In this position paper, we argue for considering both types of inputs,
as well as human-in-the-loop and incremental learning techniques, for advancing
the field of artificial intelligence and enabling autonomous systems to learn
like humans. We propose several hypotheses and design guidelines and highlight
a use case from related work to achieve this goal.",2023-09-11,2023,2023-09,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05787v1
"Life-inspired Interoceptive Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous and
  Adaptive Agents","Building autonomous -- i.e., choosing goals based on one's needs -- and
adaptive -- i.e., surviving in ever-changing environments -- agents has been a
holy grail of artificial intelligence (AI). A living organism is a prime
example of such an agent, offering important lessons about adaptive autonomy.
Here, we focus on interoception, a process of monitoring one's internal
environment to keep it within certain bounds, which underwrites the survival of
an organism. To develop AI with interoception, we need to factorize the state
variables representing internal environments from external environments and
adopt life-inspired mathematical properties of internal environment states.
This paper offers a new perspective on how interoception can help build
autonomous and adaptive agents by integrating the legacy of cybernetics with
recent advances in theories of life, reinforcement learning, and neuroscience.",2023-09-12,2023,2023-09,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05999v2
"The Animal-AI Environment: A Virtual Laboratory For Comparative
  Cognition and Artificial Intelligence Research","The Animal-AI Environment is a unique game-based research platform designed
to facilitate collaboration between the artificial intelligence and comparative
cognition research communities. In this paper, we present the latest version of
the Animal-AI Environment, outlining several major features that make the game
more engaging for humans and more complex for AI systems. These features

"From Two-Dimensional to Three-Dimensional Environment with Q-Learning:
  Modeling Autonomous Navigation with Reinforcement Learning and no Libraries","Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have become indispensable tools in
artificial intelligence, empowering agents to acquire optimal decision-making
policies through interactions with their environment and feedback mechanisms.
This study explores the performance of RL agents in both two-dimensional (2D)
and three-dimensional (3D) environments, aiming to research the dynamics of
learning across different spatial dimensions. A key aspect of this
investigation is the absence of pre-made libraries for learning, with the
algorithm developed exclusively through computational mathematics. The
methodological framework centers on RL principles, employing a Q-learning agent
class and distinct environment classes tailored to each spatial dimension. The
research aims to address the question: How do reinforcement learning agents
adapt and perform in environments of varying spatial dimensions, particularly
in 2D and 3D settings? Through empirical analysis, the study evaluates agents'
learning trajectories and adaptation processes, revealing insights into the
efficacy of RL algorithms in navigating complex, multi-dimensional spaces.
Reflections on the findings prompt considerations for future research,
particularly in understanding the dynamics of learning in higher-dimensional
environments.",2024-03-27,2024,2024-03,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18219v1

"Leveraging AI to Generate Audio for User-generated Content in Video
  Games","In video game design, audio (both environmental background music and object
sound effects) play a critical role. Sounds are typically pre-created assets
designed for specific locations or objects in a game. However, user-generated
content is becoming increasingly popular in modern games (e.g. building custom
environments or crafting unique objects). Since the possibilities are virtually
limitless, it is impossible for game creators to pre-create audio for
user-generated content. We explore the use of generative artificial
intelligence to create music and sound effects on-the-fly based on
user-generated content. We investigate two avenues for audio generation: 1)
text-to-audio: using a text description of user-generated content as input to
the audio generator, and 2) image-to-audio: using a rendering of the created
environment or object as input to an image-to-text generator, then piping the
resulting text description into the audio generator. In this paper we discuss
ethical implications of using generative artificial intelligence for
user-generated content and highlight two prototype games where audio is
generated for user-created environments and objects.",2024-04-25,2024,2024-04,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17018v1

perform functions within the required standards. Local regulations that provide
basis for the joint work of individuals and autonomous artificial intelligence

"Artificial Intelligence in Education: Ethical Considerations and
  Insights from Ancient Greek Philosophy","This paper explores the ethical implications of integrating Artificial
Intelligence (AI) in educational settings, from primary schools to
universities, while drawing insights from ancient Greek philosophy to address
emerging concerns. As AI technologies increasingly influence learning
environments, they offer novel opportunities for personalized learning,
efficient assessment, and data-driven decision-making. However, these
advancements also raise critical ethical questions regarding data privacy,
algorithmic bias, student autonomy, and the changing roles of educators. This
research examines specific use cases of AI in education, analyzing both their
potential benefits and drawbacks. By revisiting the philosophical principles of
ancient Greek thinkers such as Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato, we discuss how
their writings can guide the ethical implementation of AI in modern education.
The paper argues that while AI presents significant challenges, a balanced
approach informed by classical philosophical thought can lead to an ethically
sound transformation of education. It emphasizes the evolving role of teachers
as facilitators and the importance of fostering student initiative in AI-rich
environments.",2024-09-04,2024,2024-09,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15296v1
Multi-agent Path Finding in Continuous Environment,"We address a variant of multi-agent path finding in continuous environment
(CE-MAPF), where agents move along sets of smooth curves. Collisions between
agents are resolved via avoidance in the space domain. A new Continuous
Environment Conflict-Based Search (CE-CBS) algorithm is proposed in this work.
CE-CBS combines conflict-based search (CBS) for the high-level search framework
with RRT* for low-level path planning. The CE-CBS algorithm is tested under
various settings on diverse CE-MAPF instances. Experimental results show that
CE-CBS is competitive w.r.t. to other algorithms that consider continuous
aspect in MAPF such as MAPF with continuous time.",2024-09-16,2024,2024-09,environment,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10680v1

  Based on ROS and Multimodal Artificial Intelligence","In this paper, we propose the development of an interactive platform between
humans and a dual-arm robotic system based on the Robot Operating System (ROS)

of two main components: a dual-arm robotic hardware system and software that
includes image processing tasks and natural language processing using a 3D
camera and embedded computing. First, we designed and developed a dual-arm
robotic system with a positional accuracy of less than 2 cm, capable of
operating independently, performing industrial and service tasks while
simultaneously simulating and modeling the robot in the ROS environment.
Second, artificial intelligence models for image processing are integrated to
execute object picking and classification tasks with an accuracy of over 90%.

fascination with understanding our own intelligence. From the myths of Talos to
Aristotelian logic and Heron's inventions, we have sought to replicate the

approaches often fall short in capturing the essence of intelligence. This
paper explores how fundamental principles from biological
computation--particularly context-dependent, hierarchical information
