"Ontology-supported processing of clinical text using medical knowledge
  integration for multi-label classification of diagnosis coding","This paper discusses the knowledge integration of clinical information
extracted from distributed medical ontology in order to ameliorate a machine
learning-based multi-label coding assignment system. The proposed approach is
implemented using a decision tree based cascade hierarchical technique on the
university hospital data for patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). The

Expert-Guided Subgroup Discovery: Methodology and Application,"This paper presents an approach to expert-guided subgroup discovery. The main
step of the subgroup discovery process, the induction of subgroup descriptions,
is performed by a heuristic beam search algorithm, using a novel parametrized
definition of rule quality which is analyzed in detail. The other important
steps of the proposed subgroup discovery process are the detection of
statistically significant properties of selected subgroups and subgroup
visualization: statistically significant properties are used to enrich the
descriptions of induced subgroups, while the visualization shows subgroup
properties in the form of distributions of the numbers of examples in the
subgroups. The approach is illustrated by the results obtained for a medical
problem of early detection of patient risk groups.",2011-06-22,2011,2011-06,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4576v1
Rule Based Expert System for Cerebral Palsy Diagnosis,"The use of Artificial Intelligence is finding prominence not only in core
computer areas, but also in cross disciplinary areas including medical
diagnosis. In this paper, we present a rule based Expert System used in
diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy. The expert system takes user input and depending
on the symptoms of the patient, diagnoses if the patient is suffering from
Cerebral Palsy. The Expert System also classifies the Cerebral Palsy as mild,
moderate or severe based on the presented symptoms.",2012-06-30,2012,2012-06,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0117v1
"Dynamic Decision Support System Based on Bayesian Networks Application
  to fight against the Nosocomial Infections","The improvement of medical care quality is a significant interest for the
future years. The fight against nosocomial infections (NI) in the intensive
care units (ICU) is a good example. We will focus on a set of observations
which reflect the dynamic aspect of the decision, result of the application of
a Medical Decision Support System (MDSS). This system has to make dynamic
decision on temporal data. We use dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model this
dynamic process. It is a temporal reasoning within a real-time environment; we
are interested in the Dynamic Decision Support Systems in healthcare domain
(MDDSS).",2012-11-09,2012,2012-11,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2126v1
Fuzzy Soft Set Based Classification for Gene Expression Data,"Classification is one of the major issues in Data Mining Research fields. The

the result of medical diagnosis or description of medical treatment by the
medical practitioner. This research work discusses the classification process
of Gene Expression data for three different cancers which are breast cancer,
lung cancer and leukemia cancer with two classes which are cancerous stage and
non cancerous stage. We have applied a fuzzy soft set similarity based
classifier to enhance the accuracy to predict the stages among cancer genes and
the informative genes are selected by using Entopy filtering.",2013-01-08,2013,2013-01,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1502v1
"Artificial Intelligence Framework for Simulating Clinical
  Decision-Making: A Markov Decision Process Approach","In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the
growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that
often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose
optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a
general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence
(AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential
functions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare
policies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial
intelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines
Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical
data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential
decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic
interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in
partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)
by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an
online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real
patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily
outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service
models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a
30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further
enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly
half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation
framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain
environments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of
research and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized
medicine.",2013-01-10,2013,2013-01,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2158v1
Multiplicative Factorization of Noisy-Max,"The noisy-or and its generalization noisy-max have been utilized to reduce
the complexity of knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we present a new
representation of noisy-max that allows for efficient inference in general
Bayesian networks. Empirical studies show that our method is capable of
computing queries in well-known large medical networks, QMR-DT and CPCS, for
which no previous exact inference method has been shown to perform well.",2013-01-23,2013,2013-01,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6742v1
A Temporal Bayesian Network for Diagnosis and Prediction,"Diagnosis and prediction in some domains, like medical and industrial
diagnosis, require a representation that combines uncertainty management and
temporal reasoning. Based on the fact that in many cases there are few state
changes in the temporal range of interest, we propose a novel representation
called Temporal Nodes Bayesian Networks (TNBN). In a TNBN each node represents
an event or state change of a variable, and an arc corresponds to a
causal-temporal relationship. The temporal intervals can differ in number and
size for each temporal node, so this allows multiple granularity. Our approach
is contrasted with a dynamic Bayesian network for a simple medical example. An
empirical evaluation is presented for a more complex problem, a subsystem of a
fossil power plant, in which this approach is used for fault diagnosis and
prediction with good results.",2013-01-23,2013,2013-01,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6675v1
"Why Is Diagnosis Using Belief Networks Insensitive to Imprecision In
  Probabilities?","Recent research has found that diagnostic performance with Bayesian belief
networks is often surprisingly insensitive to imprecision in the numerical
probabilities. For example, the authors have recently completed an extensive
study in which they applied random noise to the numerical probabilities in a
set of belief networks for medical diagnosis, subsets of the CPCS network, a
subset of the QMR (Quick Medical Reference) focused on liver and bile diseases.
The diagnostic performance in terms of the average probabilities assigned to
the actual diseases showed small sensitivity even to large amounts of noise. In
this paper, we summarize the findings of this study and discuss possible
explanations of this low sensitivity. One reason is that the criterion for
performance is average probability of the true hypotheses, rather than average
error in probability, which is insensitive to symmetric noise distributions.
But, we show that even asymmetric, logodds-normal noise has modest effects. A
second reason is that the gold-standard posterior probabilities are often near
zero or one, and are little disturbed by noise.",2013-02-13,2013,2013-02,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3582v1
Efficient Decision-Theoretic Planning: Techniques and Empirical Analysis,"This paper discusses techniques for performing efficient decision-theoretic
planning. We give an overview of the DRIPS decision-theoretic refinement
planning system, which uses abstraction to efficiently identify optimal plans.
We present techniques for automatically generating search control information,
which can significantly improve the planner's performance. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRIPS both with and without the search control rules on a complex
medical planning problem and compare its performance to that of a
branch-and-bound decision tree algorithm.",2013-02-20,2013,2013-02,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4952v1
Graph-Grammar Assistance for Automated Generation of Influence Diagrams,"One of the most difficult aspects of modeling complex dilemmas in
decision-analytic terms is composing a diagram of relevance relations from a
set of domain concepts. Decision models in domains such as medicine, however,
exhibit certain prototypical patterns that can guide the modeling process.
Medical concepts can be classified according to semantic types that have
characteristic positions and typical roles in an influence-diagram model. We
have developed a graph-grammar production system that uses such inherent
interrelationships among medical terms to facilitate the modeling of medical
decisions.",2013-03-06,2013,2013-03,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1482v1
Analysis in HUGIN of Data Conflict,"After a brief introduction to causal probabilistic networks and the HUGIN
approach, the problem of conflicting data is discussed. A measure of conflict

"A Combination of Cutset Conditioning with Clique-Tree Propagation in the
  Pathfinder System","Cutset conditioning and clique-tree propagation are two popular methods for
performing exact probabilistic inference in Bayesian belief networks. Cutset
conditioning is based on decomposition of a subset of network nodes, whereas
clique-tree propagation depends on aggregation of nodes. We describe a means to
combine cutset conditioning and clique- tree propagation in an approach called
aggregation after decomposition (AD). We discuss the application of the AD
method in the Pathfinder system, a medical expert system that offers assistance
with diagnosis in hematopathology.",2013-03-27,2013,2013-03,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1114v1
Exact Reasoning Under Uncertainty,"This paper focuses on designing expert systems to support decision making in
complex, uncertain environments. In this context, our research indicates that
strictly probabilistic representations, which enable the use of
decision-theoretic reasoning, are highly preferable to recently proposed
alternatives (e.g., fuzzy set theory and Dempster-Shafer theory). Furthermore,
we discuss the language of influence diagrams and a corresponding methodology
-decision analysis -- that allows decision theory to be used effectively and
efficiently as a decision-making aid. Finally, we use RACHEL, a system that
helps infertile couples select medical treatments, to illustrate the
methodology of decision analysis as basis for expert decision systems.",2013-03-27,2013,2013-03,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3442v1

a medical diagnostic system. On-line medical data has been collected in the
hospital database system for several years. A number of induction methods are
being used to extract knowledge from the data in an attempt to improve upon
simple diagnostic charts used by the clinicians. They also enhance the results
of classical statistical methods - finding many more significant variables. The
second part of the paper describes an essentially Bayesian method of evidence

"Using Belief Functions for Uncertainty Management and Knowledge
  Acquisition: An Expert Application","This paper describes recent work on an ongoing project in medical diagnosis
at the University of Guelph. A domain on which experts are not very good at
pinpointing a single disease outcome is explored. On-line medical data is
available over a relatively short period of time. Belief Functions
(Dempster-Shafer theory) are first extracted from data and then modified with
expert opinions. Several methods for doing this are compared and results show
that one formulation statistically outperforms the others, including a method
suggested by Shafer. Expert opinions and statistically derived information
about dependencies among symptoms are also compared. The benefits of using
uncertainty management techniques as methods for knowledge acquisition from
data are discussed.",2013-03-27,2013,2013-03,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1127v1
"Experiments Using Belief Functions and Weights of Evidence incorporating
  Statistical Data and Expert Opinions","This paper presents some ideas and results of using uncertainty management
methods in the presence of data in preference to other statistical and machine
learning methods. A medical domain is used as a test-bed with data available
from a large hospital database system which collects symptom and outcome
information about patients. Data is often missing, of many variable types and
sample sizes for particular outcomes is not large. Uncertainty management
methods are useful for such domains and have the added advantage of allowing
for expert modification of belief values originally obtained from data.
Methodological considerations for using belief functions on statistical data
are dealt with in some detail. Expert opinions are Incorporated at various
levels of the project development and results are reported on an application to
liver disease diagnosis. Recent results contrasting the use of weights of
evidence and logistic regression on another medical domain are also presented.",2013-03-27,2013,2013-03,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1519v1
"Using a bag of Words for Automatic Medical Image Annotation with a
  Latent Semantic","We present in this paper a new approach for the automatic annotation of
medical images, using the approach of ""bag-of-words"" to represent the visual
content of the medical image combined with text descriptors based approach
tf.idf and reduced by latent semantic to extract the co-occurrence between
terms and visual terms. A medical report is composed of a text describing a
medical image. First, we are interested to index the text and extract all
relevant terms using a thesaurus containing MeSH medical concepts. In a second
phase, the medical image is indexed while recovering areas of interest which
are invariant to change in scale, light and tilt. To annotate a new medical
image, we use the approach of ""bagof-words"" to recover the feature vector.
Indeed, we use the vector space model to retrieve similar medical image from
the database training. The calculation of the relevance value of an image to
the query image is based on the cosine function. We conclude with an experiment
carried out on five types of radiological imaging to evaluate the performance
of our system of medical annotation. The results showed that our approach works
better with more images from the radiology of the skull.",2013-06-02,2013,2013-06,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0178v2
A hybrid decision support system : application on healthcare,"Many systems based on knowledge, especially expert systems for medical
decision support have been developed. Only systems are based on production
rules, and cannot learn and evolve only by updating them. In addition, taking
into account several criteria induces an exorbitant number of rules to be
injected into the system. It becomes difficult to translate medical knowledge
or a support decision as a simple rule. Moreover, reasoning based on generic
cases became classic and can even reduce the range of possible solutions. To
remedy that, we propose an approach based on using a multi-criteria decision
guided by a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach.",2013-11-16,2013,2013-11,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4086v1
Medical Image Fusion: A survey of the state of the art,"Medical image fusion is the process of registering and combining multiple
images from single or multiple imaging modalities to improve the imaging

notable achievements in improving clinical accuracy of decisions based on
medical images. This review article provides a factual listing of methods and
summarizes the broad scientific challenges faced in the field of medical image
fusion. We characterize the medical image fusion research based on (1) the
widely used image fusion methods, (2) imaging modalities, and (3) imaging of
organs that are under study. This review concludes that even though there

format for representing diseases that is simple and intuitive; an ability to
cope with errors and uncertainties in diagnostic information; the simplicity of
storing statistical information as frequencies of occurrence of diseases; a
method for evaluating alternative diagnostic hypotheses that yields true

"Subsumptive reflection in SNOMED CT: a large description logic-based
  terminology for diagnosis","Description logic (DL) based biomedical terminology (SNOMED CT) is used
routinely in medical practice. However, diagnostic inference using such
terminology is precluded by its complexity. Here we propose a model that
simplifies these inferential components. We propose three concepts that
classify clinical features and examined their effect on inference using SNOMED
CT. We used PAIRS (Physician Assistant Artificial Intelligence Reference
System) database (1964 findings for 485 disorders, 18 397 disease feature
links) for our analysis. We also use a 50-million medical word corpus for
estimating the vectors of disease-feature links. Our major results are 10% of
finding-disorder links are concomitant in both assertion and negation where as
90% are either concomitant in assertion or negation. Logical implications of
PAIRS data on SNOMED CT include 70% of the links do not share any common system
while 18% share organ and 12% share both system and organ. Applications of
these principles for inference are discussed and suggestions are made for
deriving a diagnostic process using SNOMED CT. Limitations of these processes
and suggestions for improvements are also discussed.",2015-12-11,2015,2015-12,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03516v1
"Harmonization of conflicting medical opinions using argumentation
  protocols and textual entailment - a case study on Parkinson disease","Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease,
affecting more than 1.2 million people in Europe. Medications are available for
the management of its symptoms, but the exact cause of the disease is unknown
and there is currently no cure on the market. To better understand the
relations between new findings and current medical knowledge, we need tools
able to analyse published medical papers based on natural language processing
and tools capable to identify various relationships of new findings with the
current medical knowledge. Our work aims to fill the above technological gap.
  To identify conflicting information in medical documents, we enact textual
entailment technology. To encapsulate existing medical knowledge, we rely on
ontologies. To connect the formal axioms in ontologies with natural text in
medical articles, we exploit ontology verbalisation techniques. To assess the
level of disagreement between human agents with respect to a medical issue, we
rely on fuzzy aggregation. To harmonize this disagreement, we design mediation
protocols within a multi-agent framework.",2016-07-27,2016,2016-07,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08075v1

classification approaches have been shown to greatly benefit from jointly
classifying subsequent sentences, such as with conditional random fields. In
this work, we present an ANN architecture that combines the effectiveness of
typical ANN models to classify sentences in isolation, with the strength of

"Learning and inference in knowledge-based probabilistic model for
  medical diagnosis","Based on a weighted knowledge graph to represent first-order knowledge and
combining it with a probabilistic model, we propose a methodology for the
creation of a medical knowledge network (MKN) in medical diagnosis. When a set
of symptoms is activated for a specific patient, we can generate a ground
medical knowledge network composed of symptom nodes and potential disease
nodes. By Incorporating a Boltzmann machine into the potential function of a
Markov network, we investigated the joint probability distribution of the MKN.
In order to deal with numerical symptoms, a multivariate inference model is
presented that uses conditional probability. In addition, the weights for the
knowledge graph were efficiently learned from manually annotated Chinese
Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs). In our experiments, we found numerically
that the optimum choice of the quality of disease node and the expression of
symptom variable can improve the effectiveness of medical diagnosis. Our
experimental results comparing a Markov logic network and the logistic
regression algorithm on an actual CEMR database indicate that our method holds
promise and that MKN can facilitate studies of intelligent diagnosis.",2017-03-28,2017,2017-03,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09368v1
Brain Intelligence: Go Beyond Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is an important technology that supports daily
social life and economic activities. It contributes greatly to the sustainable
growth of Japan's economy and solves various social problems. In recent years,
AI has attracted attention as a key for growth in developed countries such as
Europe and the United States and developing countries such as China and India.
The attention has been focused mainly on developing new artificial intelligence
information communication technology (ICT) and robot technology (RT). Although
recently developed AI technology certainly excels in extracting certain
patterns, there are many limitations. Most ICT models are overly dependent on
big data, lack a self-idea function, and are complicated. In this paper, rather
than merely developing next-generation artificial intelligence technology, we
aim to develop a new concept of general-purpose intelligence cognition
technology called Beyond AI. Specifically, we plan to develop an intelligent

"Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Understanding, Visualizing and

learning methodology, the performance of AI systems is reaching or even
exceeding the human level on an increasing number of complex tasks. Impressive
examples of this development can be found in domains such as image

playing. However, because of their nested non-linear structure, these highly
successful machine learning and artificial intelligence models are usually
applied in a black box manner, i.e., no information is provided about what
exactly makes them arrive at their predictions. Since this lack of transparency
can be a major drawback, e.g., in medical applications, the development of
methods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep learning models has
recently attracted increasing attention. This paper summarizes recent
developments in this field and makes a plea for more interpretability in
artificial intelligence. Furthermore, it presents two approaches to explaining
predictions of deep learning models, one method which computes the sensitivity
of the prediction with respect to changes in the input and one approach which
meaningfully decomposes the decision in terms of the input variables. These
methods are evaluated on three classification tasks.",2017-08-28,2017,2017-08,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08296v1

"Generating retinal flow maps from structural optical coherence
  tomography with artificial intelligence","Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for computer
vision, its application in medical imaging has been limited by the burden and
limits of expert-generated labels. We used images from optical coherence
tomography angiography (OCTA), a relatively new imaging modality that measures
perfusion of the retinal vasculature, to train an AI algorithm to generate
vasculature maps from standard structural optical coherence tomography (OCT)
images of the same retinae, both exceeding the ability and bypassing the need
for expert labeling. Deep learning was able to infer perfusion of
microvasculature from structural OCT images with similar fidelity to OCTA and
significantly better than expert clinicians (P < 0.00001). OCTA suffers from
need of specialized hardware, laborious acquisition protocols, and motion
artifacts; whereas our model works directly from standard OCT which are
ubiquitous and quick to obtain, and allows unlocking of large volumes of
previously collected standard OCT data both in existing clinical trials and
clinical practice. This finding demonstrates a novel application of AI to
medical imaging, whereby subtle regularities between different modalities are

medication is a big challenge. One way to potentially reduce this burden is to
use reminders to promote wellness throughout all stages of life and improve
medication adherence. Chatbots have proven effectiveness in triggering users to
engage in certain activity, such as medication adherence. In this paper, we
discuss ""Roborto"", a chatbot to create an engaging interactive and intelligent
environment for patients and assist in positive lifestyle modification. We
introduce a way for healthcare providers to track patients adherence and
intervene whenever necessary. We describe the health, technical and behavioural
approaches to the problem of medication non-adherence and propose a diagnostic
and decision support tool. The proposed study will be implemented and validated
through a pilot experiment with users to measure the efficacy of the proposed
approach.",2018-03-03,2018,2018-03,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09844v1

"Producing radiologist-quality reports for interpretable artificial
  intelligence","Current approaches to explaining the decisions of deep learning systems for
medical tasks have focused on visualising the elements that have contributed to
each decision. We argue that such approaches are not enough to ""open the black
box"" of medical decision making systems because they are missing a key
component that has been used as a standard communication tool between doctors
for centuries: language. We propose a model-agnostic interpretability method
that involves training a simple recurrent neural network model to produce
descriptive sentences to clarify the decision of deep learning classifiers.
  We test our method on the task of detecting hip fractures from frontal pelvic
x-rays. This process requires minimal additional labelling despite producing
text containing elements that the original deep learning classification model
was not specifically trained to detect.
  The experimental results show that: 1) the sentences produced by our method
consistently contain the desired information, 2) the generated sentences are
preferred by doctors compared to current tools that create saliency maps, and
3) the combination of visualisations and generated text is better than either
alone.",2018-06-01,2018,2018-06,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00340v1
Medical Concept Embedding with Time-Aware Attention,"Embeddings of medical concepts such as medication, procedure and diagnosis
codes in Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are central to healthcare analytics.
Previous work on medical concept embedding takes medical concepts and EMRs as
words and documents respectively. Nevertheless, such models miss out the
temporal nature of EMR data. On the one hand, two consecutive medical concepts
do not indicate they are temporally close, but the correlations between them
can be revealed by the time gap. On the other hand, the temporal scopes of
medical concepts often vary greatly (e.g., \textit{common cold} and
\textit{diabetes}). In this paper, we propose to incorporate the temporal
information to embed medical codes. Based on the Continuous Bag-of-Words model,
we employ the attention mechanism to learn a ""soft"" time-aware context window
for each medical concept. Experiments on public and proprietary datasets
through clustering and nearest neighbour search tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model, showing that it outperforms five state-of-the-art
baselines.",2018-06-06,2018,2018-06,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02873v1
Behavior Trees as a Representation for Medical Procedures,"Objective: Effective collaboration between machines and clinicians requires
flexible data structures to represent medical processes and clinical practice
guidelines. Such a data structure could enable effective turn-taking between
human and automated components of a complex treatment, accurate on-line
monitoring of clinical treatments (for example to detect medical errors), or
automated treatment systems (such as future medical robots) whose overall
treatment plan is understandable and auditable by human experts.
  Materials and Methods: Behavior trees (BTs) emerged from video game
development as a graphical language for modeling intelligent agent behavior.
BTs have several properties which are attractive for modeling medical
procedures including human-readability, authoring tools, and composability.
  Results: This paper will illustrate construction of BTs for exemplary medical
procedures and clinical protocols.

hidden layer in DBN by the extension of the algorithm. In this paper, the
proposed adaptive structural learning of DBN was applied to the comprehensive
medical examination data for the cancer prediction. The prediction system shows
higher classification accuracy (99.8% for training and 95.5% for test) than the
traditional DBN. Moreover, the explicit knowledge with respect to the relation

Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) - the phenomenon of machines being able to solve
problems that require human intelligence - has in the past decade seen an
enormous rise of interest due to significant advances in effectiveness and use.
The health sector, one of the most important sectors for societies and
economies worldwide, is particularly interesting for AI applications, given the
ongoing digitalisation of all types of health information. The potential for AI
assistance in the health domain is immense, because AI can support medical
decision making at reduced costs, everywhere. However, due to the complexity of
AI algorithms, it is difficult to distinguish good from bad AI-based solutions
and to understand their strengths and weaknesses, which is crucial for
clarifying responsibilities and for building trust. For this reason, the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has established a new Focus Group
on ""Artificial Intelligence for Health"" (FG-AI4H) in partnership with the World
Health Organization (WHO). Health and care services are usually the
responsibility of a government - even when provided through private insurance
systems - and thus under the responsibility of WHO/ITU member states. FG-AI4H
will identify opportunities for international standardization, which will
foster the application of AI to health issues on a global scale. In particular,
it will establish a standardized assessment framework with open benchmarks for
the evaluation of AI-based methods for health, such as AI-based diagnosis,

On the Generation of Medical Question-Answer Pairs,"Question answering (QA) has achieved promising progress recently. However,
answering a question in real-world scenarios like the medical domain is still
challenging, due to the requirement of external knowledge and the insufficient
quantity of high-quality training data. In the light of these challenges, we
study the task of generating medical QA pairs in this paper. With the insight
that each medical question can be considered as a sample from the latent
distribution of questions given answers, we propose an automated medical QA
pair generation framework, consisting of an unsupervised key phrase detector
that explores unstructured material for validity, and a generator that involves
a multi-pass decoder to integrate structural knowledge for diversity. A series
of experiments have been conducted on a real-world dataset collected from the
National Medical Licensing Examination of China. Both automatic evaluation and
human annotation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Further
investigation shows that, by incorporating the generated QA pairs for training,
significant improvement in terms of accuracy can be achieved for the
examination QA system.",2018-11-01,2018,2018-11,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00681v2
Multimodal Densenet,"Humans make accurate decisions by interpreting complex data from multiple
sources. Medical diagnostics, in particular, often hinge on human
interpretation of multi-modal information. In order for artificial intelligence
to make progress in automated, objective, and accurate diagnosis and prognosis,
methods to fuse information from multiple medical imaging modalities are
required. However, combining information from multiple data sources has several
challenges, as current deep learning architectures lack the ability to extract
useful representations from multimodal information, and often simple
concatenation is used to fuse such information. In this work, we propose
Multimodal DenseNet, a novel architecture for fusing multimodal data. Instead
of focusing on concatenation or early and late fusion, our proposed
architectures fuses information over several layers and gives the model
flexibility in how it combines information from multiple sources. We apply this
architecture to the challenge of polyp characterization and landmark
identification in endoscopy. Features from white light images are fused with
features from narrow band imaging or depth maps. This study demonstrates that
Multimodal DenseNet outperforms monomodal classification as well as other
multimodal fusion techniques by a significant margin on two different datasets.",2018-11-18,2018,2018-11,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07407v1
Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Sepsis Treatment,"Sepsis is a dangerous condition that is a leading cause of patient mortality.
Treating sepsis is highly challenging, because individual patients respond very
differently to medical interventions and there is no universally agreed-upon
treatment for sepsis. In this work, we explore the use of continuous

treatment policies for sepsis patients. Our quantitative evaluation reveals
that by blending the treatment strategy discovered with RL with what clinicians

applications, requires the segmentation of images into bone, soft tissue, and
open beam regions. We apply a machine learning approach to this problem,
presenting an end-to-end solution which results in robust and efficient
inference. Since medical institutions frequently do not have the resources to
process and label the large quantity of X-Ray images usually needed for neural
network training, we design an end-to-end solution for small datasets, while
achieving state-of-the-art results. Our implementation produces an overall
accuracy of 92%, F1 score of 0.92, and an AUC of 0.98, surpassing classical

challenges for medical work. On the positive side, intelligent systems have the
potential to compute complex data from patients and generate automated
diagnosis recommendations for doctors. However, medical professionals often
perceive such systems as black boxes and, therefore, feel concerned about
relying on system generated results to make decisions. In this paper, we
contribute to the ongoing discussion of explainable artificial intelligence

as explainable if the system was designed to think and act like doctors. We
report a preliminary interview study that collected six medical professionals'
reflection of how they interact with data for diagnosis and treatment purposes.
Our data reveals when and how doctors prioritize among various types of data as

"Parallel Medical Imaging for Intelligent Medical Image Analysis:
  Concepts, Methods, and Applications","There has been much progress in data-driven artificial intelligence
technology for medical image analysis in the last decades. However, it still
remains challenging due to its distinctive complexity of acquiring and
annotating image data, extracting medical domain knowledge, and explaining the
diagnostic decision for medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a
data-knowledge-driven framework termed as Parallel Medical Imaging (PMI) for
intelligent medical image analysis based on the methodology of interactive
ACP-based parallel intelligence. In the PMI framework, computational
experiments with predictive learning in a data-driven way are conducted to
extract medical knowledge for diagnostic decision support. Artificial imaging
systems are introduced to select and prescriptively generate medical image data
in a knowledge-driven way to utilize medical domain knowledge. Through the
closed-loop optimization based on parallel execution, our proposed PMI

Learning More with Less: GAN-based Medical Image Augmentation,"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based accurate prediction typically
requires large-scale annotated training data. In Medical Imaging, however, both
obtaining medical data and annotating them by expert physicians are
challenging; to overcome this lack of data, Data Augmentation (DA) using
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is essential, since they can synthesize
additional annotated training data to handle small and fragmented medical
images from various scanners--those generated images, realistic but completely
novel, can further fill the real image distribution uncovered by the original
dataset. As a tutorial, this paper introduces GAN-based Medical Image
Augmentation, along with tricks to boost classification/object
detection/segmentation performance using them, based on our experience and
related work. Moreover, we show our first GAN-based DA work using automatic
bounding box annotation, for robust CNN-based brain metastases detection on 256

"MedGCN: Medication recommendation and lab test imputation via graph
  convolutional networks","Laboratory testing and medication prescription are two of the most important
routines in daily clinical practice. Developing an artificial intelligence
system that can automatically make lab test imputations and medication
recommendations can save costs on potentially redundant lab tests and inform
physicians of a more effective prescription. We present an intelligent medical
system (named MedGCN) that can automatically recommend the patients'
medications based on their incomplete lab tests, and can even accurately
estimate the lab values that have not been taken. In our system, we integrate
the complex relations between multiple types of medical entities with their
inherent features in a heterogeneous graph. Then we model the graph to learn a
distributed representation for each entity in the graph based on graph
convolutional networks (GCN). By the propagation of graph convolutional
networks, the entity representations can incorporate multiple types of medical
information that can benefit multiple medical tasks. Moreover, we introduce a
cross regularization strategy to reduce overfitting for multi-task training by
the interaction between the multiple tasks. In this study, we construct a graph
to associate 4 types of medical entities, i.e., patients, encounters, lab
tests, and medications, and applied a graph neural network to learn node
embeddings for medication recommendation and lab test imputation. we validate
our MedGCN model on two real-world datasets: NMEDW and MIMIC-III. The
experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that our model can outperform
the state-of-the-art in both tasks. We believe that our innovative system can

"Pre-training of Graph Augmented Transformers for Medication
  Recommendation","Medication recommendation is an important healthcare application. It is
commonly formulated as a temporal prediction task. Hence, most existing works
only utilize longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) from a small number
of patients with multiple visits ignoring a large number of patients with a
single visit (selection bias). Moreover, important hierarchical knowledge such
as diagnosis hierarchy is not leveraged in the representation learning process.
To address these challenges, we propose G-BERT, a new model to combine the
power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers) for medical code representation and
medication recommendation. We use GNNs to represent the internal hierarchical
structures of medical codes. Then we integrate the GNN representation into a
transformer-based visit encoder and pre-train it on EHR data from patients only
with a single visit. The pre-trained visit encoder and representation are then
fine-tuned for downstream predictive tasks on longitudinal EHRs from patients
with multiple visits. G-BERT is the first to bring the language model
pre-training schema into the healthcare domain and it achieved state-of-the-art

UQ models ought to know when the classification models act incorrectly, we
design a new evaluation metric, area under Confidence-Classification
Characteristic curves (AUCCC), to quantitatively evaluate the performance of
the UQ models. AUCCC is threshold-free, robust to perturbation, and insensitive
to the classification performance. We evaluate several UQ methods (e.g., max
softmax output) with AUCCC to validate its effectiveness. Furthermore, a simple
scheme, named Uncertainty Distillation (UDist), is developed to boost the UQ

A New Approach for Explainable Multiple Organ Annotation with Few Data,"Despite the recent successes of deep learning, such models are still far from
some human abilities like learning from few examples, reasoning and explaining
decisions. In this paper, we focus on organ annotation in medical images and we
introduce a reasoning framework that is based on learning fuzzy relations on a
small dataset for generating explanations. Given a catalogue of relations, it
efficiently induces the most relevant relations and combines them for building
constraints in order to both solve the organ annotation task and generate
explanations. We test our approach on a publicly available dataset of medical
images where several organs are already segmented. A demonstration of our model
is proposed with an example of explained annotations. It was trained on a small

of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Medicine and Health Care and presents a
classification according to their ethical and societal aspects, potential

  This work is based on an analysis of the state of the art of research and
technology, including existing software, personal monitoring devices, genetic
tests and editing tools, personalized digital models, online platforms,
augmented reality devices, and surgical and companion robotics. Motivated by
our review, we present and describe the notion of 'extended personalized

healthcare and explore the public perception of medical AI systems, and how
they show, simultaneously, extraordinary opportunities and drawbacks that even
question fundamental medical concepts. Many of these topics coincide with
urgent priorities recently defined by the World Health Organization for the
coming decade. In addition, we study the transformations of the roles of
doctors and patients in an age of ubiquitous information, identify the risk of
a division of Medicine into 'fake-based', 'patient-generated', and
'scientifically tailored', and draw the attention of some aspects that need

"Deepfakes for Medical Video De-Identification: Privacy Protection and
  Diagnostic Information Preservation","Data sharing for medical research has been difficult as open-sourcing
clinical data may violate patient privacy. Traditional methods for face
de-identification wipe out facial information entirely, making it impossible to
analyze facial behavior. Recent advancements on whole-body keypoints detection
also rely on facial input to estimate body keypoints. Both facial and body
keypoints are critical in some medical diagnoses, and keypoints invariability
after de-identification is of great importance. Here, we propose a solution
using deepfake technology, the face swapping technique. While this swapping
method has been criticized for invading privacy and portraiture right, it could
conversely protect privacy in medical video: patients' faces could be swapped
to a proper target face and become unrecognizable. However, it remained an open
question that to what extent the swapping de-identification method could affect
the automatic detection of body keypoints. In this study, we apply deepfake
technology to Parkinson's disease examination videos to de-identify subjects,
and quantitatively show that: face-swapping as a de-identification approach is
reliable, and it keeps the keypoints almost invariant, significantly better
than traditional methods. This study proposes a pipeline for video
de-identification and keypoint preservation, clearing up some ethical
restrictions for medical data sharing. This work could make open-source high
quality medical video datasets more feasible and promote future medical
research that benefits our society.",2020-02-07,2020,2020-02,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00813v1
"From Bit To Bedside: A Practical Framework For Artificial Intelligence

are typically required to proceed through a three-phase process to the market
launch of a validated medical AI product. We focus on issues related to
Clinical validation, Regulatory affairs, Data strategy and Algorithmic
development. The development process we propose for AI in healthcare software
strongly diverges from modern consumer software development processes. We
highlight the key time points to guide founders, investors and key stakeholders

"Review of Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Imaging Data
  Acquisition, Segmentation and Diagnosis for COVID-19","(This paper was submitted as an invited paper to IEEE Reviews in Biomedical
Engineering on April 6, 2020.) The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and
computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against
COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical
specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical
imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image
acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also
reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best
protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by
accurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating
subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help
radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking,
and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of
medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image
acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on
the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the

"Unifying Neural Learning and Symbolic Reasoning for Spinal Medical
  Report Generation","Automated medical report generation in spine radiology, i.e., given spinal
medical images and directly create radiologist-level diagnosis reports to
support clinical decision making, is a novel yet fundamental study in the
domain of artificial intelligence in healthcare. However, it is incredibly
challenging because it is an extremely complicated task that involves visual
perception and high-level reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose the
neural-symbolic learning (NSL) framework that performs human-like learning by
unifying deep neural learning and symbolic logical reasoning for the spinal
medical report generation. Generally speaking, the NSL framework firstly
employs deep neural learning to imitate human visual perception for detecting
abnormalities of target spinal structures. Concretely, we design an adversarial
graph network that interpolates a symbolic graph reasoning module into a
generative adversarial network through embedding prior domain knowledge,
achieving semantic segmentation of spinal structures with high complexity and
variability. NSL secondly conducts human-like symbolic logical reasoning that
realizes unsupervised causal effect analysis of detected entities of
abnormalities through meta-interpretive learning. NSL finally fills these
discoveries of target diseases into a unified template, successfully achieving
a comprehensive medical report generation. When it employed in a real-world
clinical dataset, a series of empirical studies demonstrate its capacity on
spinal medical report generation as well as show that our algorithm remarkably
exceeds existing methods in the detection of spinal structures. These indicate
its potential as a clinical tool that contributes to computer-aided diagnosis.",2020-04-28,2020,2020-04,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13577v1

Medical idioms for clinical Bayesian network development,"Bayesian Networks (BNs) are graphical probabilistic models that have proven
popular in medical applications. While numerous medical BNs have been
published, most are presented fait accompli without explanation of how the
network structure was developed or justification of why it represents the
correct structure for the given medical application. This means that the
process of building medical BNs from experts is typically ad hoc and offers
little opportunity for methodological improvement. This paper proposes
generally applicable and reusable medical reasoning patterns to aid those
developing medical BNs. The proposed method complements and extends the
idiom-based approach introduced by Neil, Fenton, and Nielsen in 2000. We
propose instances of their generic idioms that are specific to medical BNs. We
refer to the proposed medical reasoning patterns as medical idioms. In
addition, we extend the use of idioms to represent interventional and
counterfactual reasoning. We believe that the proposed medical idioms are
logical reasoning patterns that can be combined, reused and applied generically
to help develop medical BNs. All proposed medical idioms have been illustrated
using medical examples on coronary artery disease. The method has also been
applied to other ongoing BNs being developed with medical experts. Finally, we
show that applying the proposed medical idioms to published BN models results
in models with a clearer structure.",2020-07-01,2020,2020-07,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00364v2

"ExplAIn: Explanatory Artificial Intelligence for Diabetic Retinopathy
  Diagnosis","In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proven its relevance for
medical decision support. However, the ""black-box"" nature of successful AI
algorithms still holds back their wide-spread deployment. In this paper, we
describe an eXplanatory Artificial Intelligence (XAI) that reaches the same
level of performance as black-box AI, for the task of classifying Diabetic
Retinopathy (DR) severity using Color Fundus Photography (CFP). This algorithm,
called ExplAIn, learns to segment and categorize lesions in images; the final
image-level classification directly derives from these multivariate lesion
segmentations. The novelty of this explanatory framework is that it is trained
from end to end, with image supervision only, just like black-box AI
algorithms: the concepts of lesions and lesion categories emerge by themselves.
For improved lesion localization, foreground/background separation is trained
through self-supervision, in such a way that occluding foreground pixels
transforms the input image into a healthy-looking image. The advantage of such
an architecture is that automatic diagnoses can be explained simply by an image
and/or a few sentences. ExplAIn is evaluated at the image level and at the
pixel level on various CFP image datasets. We expect this new framework, which
jointly offers high classification performance and explainability, to

"Dr. Summarize: Global Summarization of Medical Dialogue by Exploiting
  Local Structures","Understanding a medical conversation between a patient and a physician poses
a unique natural language understanding challenge since it combines elements of

  In this paper we present a novel approach to medical conversation
summarization that leverages the unique and independent local structures
created when gathering a patient's medical history. Our approach is a variation
of the pointer generator network where we introduce a penalty on the generator

important properties of medical conversations such as medical knowledge coming
from standardized medical ontologies better than when those concepts are
introduced explicitly. Through evaluation by doctors, we show that our approach

"MedDG: An Entity-Centric Medical Consultation Dataset for Entity-Aware
  Medical Dialogue Generation","Developing conversational agents to interact with patients and provide
primary clinical advice has attracted increasing attention due to its huge
application potential, especially in the time of COVID-19 Pandemic. However,
the training of end-to-end neural-based medical dialogue system is restricted
by an insufficient quantity of medical dialogue corpus. In this work, we make
the first attempt to build and release a large-scale high-quality Medical
Dialogue dataset related to 12 types of common Gastrointestinal diseases named
MedDG, with more than 17K conversations collected from the online health
consultation community. Five different categories of entities, including
diseases, symptoms, attributes, tests, and medicines, are annotated in each
conversation of MedDG as additional labels. To push forward the future research
on building expert-sensitive medical dialogue system, we proposes two kinds of
medical dialogue tasks based on MedDG dataset. One is the next entity
prediction and the other is the doctor response generation. To acquire a clear
comprehension on these two medical dialogue tasks, we implement several
state-of-the-art benchmarks, as well as design two dialogue models with a
further consideration on the predicted entities. Experimental results show that
the pre-train language models and other baselines struggle on both tasks with
poor performance in our dataset, and the response quality can be enhanced with
the help of auxiliary entity information. From human evaluation, the simple

Explainable AI meets Healthcare: A Study on Heart Disease Dataset,"With the increasing availability of structured and unstructured data and the
swift progress of analytical techniques, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
bringing a revolution to the healthcare industry. With the increasingly
indispensable role of AI in healthcare, there are growing concerns over the
lack of transparency and explainability in addition to potential bias
encountered by predictions of the model. This is where Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) comes into the picture. XAI increases the trust placed in an
AI system by medical practitioners as well as AI researchers, and thus,
eventually, leads to an increasingly widespread deployment of AI in healthcare.
  In this paper, we present different interpretability techniques. The aim is
to enlighten practitioners on the understandability and interpretability of
explainable AI systems using a variety of techniques available which can be
very advantageous in the health-care domain. Medical diagnosis model is
responsible for human life and we need to be confident enough to treat a
patient as instructed by a black-box model. Our paper contains examples based
on the heart disease dataset and elucidates on how the explainability
techniques should be preferred to create trustworthiness while using AI systems
in healthcare.",2020-11-06,2020,2020-11,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03195v1
"Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 Detection -- A state-of-the-art
  review","The emergence of COVID-19 has necessitated many efforts by the scientific
community for its proper management. An urgent clinical reaction is required in
the face of the unending devastation being caused by the pandemic. These
efforts include technological innovations for improvement in screening,
treatment, vaccine development, contact tracing and, survival prediction. The
use of Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be sought in all
of the above-mentioned spheres. This paper aims to review the role of Deep
Learning and Artificial intelligence in various aspects of the overall COVID-19
management and particularly for COVID-19 detection and classification. The DL
models are developed to analyze clinical modalities like CT scans and X-Ray
images of patients and predict their pathological condition. A DL model aims to
detect the COVID-19 pneumonia, classify and distinguish between COVID-19,
Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, and normal
conditions. Furthermore, sophisticated models can be built to segment the
affected area in the lungs and quantify the infection volume for a better
understanding of the extent of damage. Many models have been developed either
independently or with the help of pre-trained models like VGG19, ResNet50, and
AlexNet leveraging the concept of transfer learning. Apart from model
development, data preprocessing and augmentation are also performed to cope
with the challenge of insufficient data samples often encountered in medical
applications. It can be evaluated that DL and AI can be effectively implemented
to withstand the challenges posed by the global emergency",2020-11-25,2020,2020-11,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06310v1

"The Medical Authority of AI: A Study of AI-enabled Consumer-facing
  Health Technology","Recently, consumer-facing health technologies such as Artificial Intelligence
(AI)-based symptom checkers (AISCs) have sprung up in everyday healthcare
practice. AISCs solicit symptom information from users and provide medical
suggestions and possible diagnoses, a responsibility that people usually
entrust with real-person authorities such as physicians and expert patients.
Thus, the advent of AISCs begs a question of whether and how they transform the
notion of medical authority in everyday healthcare practice. To answer this
question, we conducted an interview study with thirty AISC users. We found that
users assess the medical authority of AISCs using various factors including
automated decisions and interaction design patterns of AISC apps, associations
with established medical authorities like hospitals, and comparisons with other
health technologies. We reveal how AISCs are used in healthcare delivery,
discuss how AI transforms conventional understandings of medical authority, and

Diagnosis of Acute Poisoning Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"Medical toxicology is the clinical specialty that treats the toxic effects of
substances, be it an overdose, a medication error, or a scorpion sting. The
volume of toxicological knowledge and research has, as with other medical
specialties, outstripped the ability of the individual clinician to entirely
master and stay current with it. The application of machine learning techniques
to medical toxicology is challenging because initial treatment decisions are
often based on a few pieces of textual data and rely heavily on prior
knowledge. ML techniques often do not represent knowledge in a way that is
transparent for the physician, raising barriers to usability. Rule-based
systems and decision tree learning are more transparent approaches, but often
generalize poorly and require expert curation to implement and maintain. Here,
we construct a probabilistic logic network to represent a portion of the
knowledge base of a medical toxicologist. Our approach transparently mimics the
knowledge representation and clinical decision-making of practicing clinicians.
The software, dubbed Tak, performs comparably to humans on straightforward
cases and intermediate difficulty cases, but is outperformed by humans on
challenging clinical cases. Tak outperforms a decision tree classifier at all
levels of difficulty. Probabilistic logic provides one form of explainable
artificial intelligence that may be more acceptable for use in healthcare, if
it can achieve acceptable levels of performance.",2021-02-01,2021,2021-02,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01116v1

"The Ethical Implications of Shared Medical Decision Making without
  Providing Adequate Computational Support to the Care Provider and to the
  Patient","There is a clear need to involve patients in medical decisions. However,
cognitive psychological research has highlighted the cognitive limitations of
humans with respect to 1. Probabilistic assessment of the patient state and of
potential outcomes of various decisions, 2. Elicitation of the patient utility
function, and 3. Integration of the probabilistic knowledge and of patient
preferences to determine the optimal strategy. Therefore, without adequate
computational support, current shared decision models have severe ethical
deficiencies. An informed consent model unfairly transfers the responsibility
to a patient who does not have the necessary knowledge, nor the integration
capability. A paternalistic model endows with exaggerated power a physician who
might not be aware of the patient preferences, is prone to multiple cognitive
biases, and whose computational integration capability is bounded. Recent
progress in Artificial Intelligence suggests adding a third agent: a computer,
in all deliberative medical decisions: Non emergency medical decisions in which
more than one alternative exists, the patient preferences can be elicited, the
therapeutic alternatives might be influenced by these preferences, medical
knowledge exists regarding the likelihood of the decision outcomes, and there
is sufficient decision time. Ethical physicians should exploit computational
decision support technologies, neither making the decisions solely on their
own, nor shirking their duty and shifting the responsibility to patients in the
name of informed consent. The resulting three way (patient, care provider,
computer) human machine model that we suggest emphasizes the patient
preferences, the physician knowledge, and the computational integration of both
aspects, does not diminish the physician role, but rather brings out the best
in human and machine.",2021-02-03,2021,2021-02,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01811v1

  Usability of XAI","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a rising field in AI. It aims to
produce a demonstrative factor of trust, which for human subjects is achieved
through communicative means, which Machine Learning (ML) algorithms cannot

visualization of the feature contribution towards a given models output on both
a local and global level. The work in this paper uses XAI to determine feature
importance towards high-dimensional data-driven questions to inform
domain-experts of identifiable trends with a comparison of model-agnostic

"Contextualized Keyword Representations for Multi-modal Retinal Image
  Captioning","Medical image captioning automatically generates a medical description to
describe the content of a given medical image. A traditional medical image
captioning model creates a medical description only based on a single medical
image input. Hence, an abstract medical description or concept is hard to be
generated based on the traditional approach. Such a method limits the
effectiveness of medical image captioning. Multi-modal medical image captioning
is one of the approaches utilized to address this problem. In multi-modal
medical image captioning, textual input, e.g., expert-defined keywords, is
considered as one of the main drivers of medical description generation. Thus,
encoding the textual input and the medical image effectively are both important
for the task of multi-modal medical image captioning. In this work, a new
end-to-end deep multi-modal medical image captioning model is proposed.
Contextualized keyword representations, textual feature reinforcement, and
masked self-attention are used to develop the proposed approach. Based on the
evaluation of the existing multi-modal medical image captioning dataset,
experimental results show that the proposed model is effective with the
increase of +53.2% in BLEU-avg and +18.6% in CIDEr, compared with the

"Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Human Decision-Support System in
  Medical Domain","In the present paper we present the potential of Explainable Artificial
Intelligence methods for decision-support in medical image analysis scenarios.
With three types of explainable methods applied to the same medical image data
set our aim was to improve the comprehensibility of the decisions provided by
the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The visual explanations were provided
on in-vivo gastral images obtained from a Video capsule endoscopy (VCE), with
the goal of increasing the health professionals' trust in the black box
predictions. We implemented two post-hoc interpretable machine learning methods
LIME and SHAP and the alternative explanation approach CIU, centered on the
Contextual Value and Utility (CIU). The produced explanations were evaluated
using human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on the
explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical
backgrounds carried out a series of tests in the web-based survey setting and
stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user
groups (n=20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were
quantitatively analyzed. We have found that, as hypothesized, the CIU
explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of
increasing support for human decision-making as well as being more transparent
and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP
by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are
notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation
support settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable
methods that can with future improvements in implementation be generalized on
different medical data sets and can provide great decision-support for medical

"Change Matters: Medication Change Prediction with Recurrent Residual
  Networks","Deep learning is revolutionizing predictive healthcare, including
recommending medications to patients with complex health conditions. Existing
approaches focus on predicting all medications for the current visit, which
often overlaps with medications from previous visits. A more clinically
relevant task is to identify medication changes.
  In this paper, we propose a new recurrent residual network, named MICRON, for
medication change prediction. MICRON takes the changes in patient health
records as input and learns to update a hidden medication vector and the
medication set recurrently with a reconstruction design. The medication vector
is like the memory cell that encodes longitudinal information of medications.
Unlike traditional methods that require the entire patient history for
prediction, MICRON has a residual-based inference that allows for sequential
updating based only on new patient features (e.g., new diagnoses in the recent
visit) more efficiently.
  We evaluated MICRON on real inpatient and outpatient datasets. MICRON
achieves 3.5% and 7.8% relative improvements over the best baseline in F1
score, respectively. MICRON also requires fewer parameters, which significantly

Bayesian Teaching, a formal account of explanation rooted in the cognitive
science of human learning. We find that medical experts exposed to explanations
generated by Bayesian Teaching successfully predict the AI's diagnostic

Multimodal AutoEncoder (TMAE), an unsupervised learning framework that can
learn efficient patient representation by encoding meaningful information from
the claims data. TMAE is motivated by the practical needs in healthcare to
stratify patients into different risk levels for improving care delivery and

inpatient, outpatient, and medication claims collectively, 2) handle irregular
time intervals between medical events, 3) alleviate the sparsity issue of the
rare medical codes, and 4) incorporate medical expenditure information. We
trained TMAE using a real-world pediatric claims dataset containing more than
600,000 patients and compared its performance with various approaches in two

The problem of implementing artificial intelligence on edge devices is the
complexity and high resource intensity of the most known neural network data
analysis methods and algorithms. The difficulty of implementing these methods
on low-power microcontrollers with small memory size calls for the development
of new effective algorithms for neural networks. This study presents a new
method for analyzing medical data based on the LogNNet neural network, which
uses chaotic mappings to transform input information. The method effectively
solves classification problems and calculates risk factors for the presence of
a disease in a patient according to a set of medical health indicators. The
efficiency of LogNNet in assessing perinatal risk is illustrated on
cardiotocogram data obtained from the UC Irvine machine learning repository.
The classification accuracy reaches ~91% with the ~3-10 kB of RAM used on the
Arduino microcontroller. Using the LogNNet network trained on a publicly
available database of the Israeli Ministry of Health, a service concept for
COVID-19 express testing is provided. A classification accuracy of ~95% is
achieved, and ~0.6 kB of RAM is used. In all examples, the model is tested
using standard classification quality metrics: precision, recall, and
F1-measure. The LogNNet architecture allows the implementation of artificial
intelligence on medical peripherals of the Internet of Things with low RAM
resources and can be used in clinical decision support systems.",2021-08-05,2021,2021-08,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02428v2
"Symptom based Hierarchical Classification of Diabetes and Thyroid
  disorders using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps","Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are soft computing technique that follows an
approach similar to human reasoning and human decision-making process, making
them a valuable modeling and simulation methodology. Medical Decision Systems
are complex systems consisting of many factors that may be complementary,
contradictory, and competitive; these factors influence each other and
determine the overall diagnosis with a different degree. Thus, FCMs are
suitable to model Medical Decision Support Systems. The proposed work therefore
uses FCMs arranged in hierarchical structure to classify between Diabetes,
Thyroid disorders and their subtypes. Subtypes include type 1 and type 2 for
diabetes and hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism for thyroid.",2021-08-08,2021,2021-08,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03760v1

Artificial Intelligence in Dry Eye Disease,"Dry eye disease (DED) has a prevalence of between 5 and 50\%, depending on
the diagnostic criteria used and population under study. However, it remains
one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated conditions in ophthalmology.
Many tests used in the diagnosis of DED rely on an experienced observer for
image interpretation, which may be considered subjective and result in
variation in diagnosis. Since artificial intelligence (AI) systems are capable
of advanced problem solving, use of such techniques could lead to more
objective diagnosis. Although the term `AI' is commonly used, recent success in
its applications to medicine is mainly due to advancements in the sub-field of
machine learning, which has been used to automatically classify images and
predict medical outcomes. Powerful machine learning techniques have been
harnessed to understand nuances in patient data and medical images, aiming for
consistent diagnosis and stratification of disease severity. This is the first
literature review on the use of AI in DED. We provide a brief introduction to
AI, report its current use in DED research and its potential for application in
the clinic. Our review found that AI has been employed in a wide range of DED
clinical tests and research applications, primarily for interpretation of
interferometry, slit-lamp and meibography images. While initial results are
promising, much work is still needed on model development, clinical testing and
standardisation.",2021-09-02,2021,2021-09,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01658v1
"Readying Medical Students for Medical AI: The Need to Embed AI Ethics
  Education","Medical students will almost inevitably encounter powerful medical AI systems
early in their careers. Yet, contemporary medical education does not adequately
equip students with the basic clinical proficiency in medical AI needed to use
these tools safely and effectively. Education reform is urgently needed, but
not easily implemented, largely due to an already jam-packed medical curricula.
In this article, we propose an education reform framework as an effective and
efficient solution, which we call the Embedded AI Ethics Education Framework.
Unlike other calls for education reform to accommodate AI teaching that are
more radical in scope, our framework is modest and incremental. It leverages
existing bioethics or medical ethics curricula to develop and deliver content
on the ethical issues associated with medical AI, especially the harms of
technology misuse, disuse, and abuse that affect the risk-benefit analyses at
the heart of healthcare. In doing so, the framework provides a simple tool for
going beyond the ""What?"" and the ""Why?"" of medical AI ethics education, to
answer the ""How?"", giving universities, course directors, and/or professors a
broad road-map for equipping their students with the necessary clinical
proficiency in medical AI.",2021-09-07,2021,2021-09,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02866v1
"Medically Aware GPT-3 as a Data Generator for Medical Dialogue
  Summarization","In medical dialogue summarization, summaries must be coherent and must
capture all the medically relevant information in the dialogue. However,
learning effective models for summarization require large amounts of labeled

synthetic training data with an explicit focus on capturing medically relevant
information. We utilize GPT-3 as the backbone of our algorithm and scale 210
human labeled examples to yield results comparable to using 6400 human labeled
examples (~30x) leveraging low-shot learning and an ensemble method. In
detailed experiments, we show that this approach produces high quality training
data that can further be combined with human labeled data to get summaries that
are strongly preferable to those produced by models trained on human data alone

Toward a Perspectivist Turn in Ground Truthing for Predictive Computing,"Most Artificial Intelligence applications are based on supervised machine
learning (ML), which ultimately grounds on manually annotated data. The
annotation process is often performed in terms of a majority vote and this has
been proved to be often problematic, as highlighted by recent studies on the
evaluation of ML models. In this article we describe and advocate for a
different paradigm, which we call data perspectivism, which moves away from
traditional gold standard datasets, towards the adoption of methods that
integrate the opinions and perspectives of the human subjects involved in the
knowledge representation step of ML processes. Drawing on previous works which
inspired our proposal we describe the potential of our proposal for not only
the more subjective tasks (e.g. those related to human language) but also to
tasks commonly understood as objective (e.g. medical decision making), and
present the main advantages of adopting a perspectivist stance in ML, as well
as possible disadvantages, and various ways in which such a stance can be
implemented in practice. Finally, we share a set of recommendations and outline
a research agenda to advance the perspectivist stance in ML.",2021-09-09,2021,2021-09,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04270v3

"Co-Correcting: Noise-tolerant Medical Image Classification via mutual
  Label Correction","With the development of deep learning, medical image classification has been
significantly improved. However, deep learning requires massive data with
labels. While labeling the samples by human experts is expensive and
time-consuming, collecting labels from crowd-sourcing suffers from the noises
which may degenerate the accuracy of classifiers. Therefore, approaches that
can effectively handle label noises are highly desired. Unfortunately, recent
progress on handling label noise in deep learning has gone largely unnoticed by
the medical image. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a noise-tolerant
medical image classification framework named Co-Correcting, which significantly
improves classification accuracy and obtains more accurate labels through
dual-network mutual learning, label probability estimation, and curriculum
label correcting. On two representative medical image datasets and the MNIST
dataset, we test six latest Learning-with-Noisy-Labels methods and conduct
comparative studies. The experiments show that Co-Correcting achieves the best
accuracy and generalization under different noise ratios in various tasks. Our

"FUTURE-AI: Guiding Principles and Consensus Recommendations for
  Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging","The recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) combined with the
extensive amount of data generated by today's clinical systems, has led to the
development of imaging AI solutions across the whole value chain of medical
imaging, including image reconstruction, medical image segmentation,
image-based diagnosis and treatment planning. Notwithstanding the successes and
future potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of
the potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are
perceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust
in critical clinical applications. Addressing these concerns and risks, the
FUTURE-AI framework has been proposed, which, sourced from a global
multi-domain expert consensus, comprises guiding principles for increased
trust, safety, and adoption for AI in healthcare. In this paper, we transform
the general FUTURE-AI healthcare principles to a concise and specific AI
implementation guide tailored to the needs of the medical imaging community. To
this end, we carefully assess each building block of the FUTURE-AI framework
consisting of (i) Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv)
Usability, (v) Robustness and (vi) Explainability, and respectively define
concrete best practices based on accumulated AI implementation experiences from
five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. We accompany our concrete

this study, quantum computing was applied to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic

Specifically, the independence measure of DirectLiNGAM, a causal discovery

real-world medical data was verified. When DirectLiNGAM with the quantum kernel
(qLiNGAM) was applied to real-world medical data, a case was confirmed in which
the causal structure could be correctly estimated when the amount of data was
small, which was not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, qLiNGAM was

The Prominence of Artificial Intelligence in COVID-19,"In December 2019, a novel virus called COVID-19 had caused an enormous number
of causalities to date. The battle with the novel Coronavirus is baffling and

researchers have made significant progress in controlling the spread of the
highly contiguous virus, technology has also proved its significance in the
battle. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence has been adopted in many medical
applications to diagnose many diseases, even baffling experienced doctors.
Therefore, this survey paper explores the methodologies proposed that can aid
doctors and researchers in early and inexpensive methods of diagnosis of the

the conventional manner, but a significant way can be adopted with Machine and
Deep Learning. On the other hand, the access to different types of medical

techniques are proposed. This paper first details the background knowledge of
the conventional methods in the Artificial Intelligence domain. Following that,
we gather the commonly used datasets and their use cases to date. In addition,
we also show the percentage of researchers adopting Machine Learning over Deep

"Label-dependent and event-guided interpretable disease risk prediction
  using EHRs","Electronic health records (EHRs) contain patients' heterogeneous data that
are collected from medical providers involved in the patient's care, including
medical notes, clinical events, laboratory test results, symptoms, and
diagnoses. In the field of modern healthcare, predicting whether patients would
experience any risks based on their EHRs has emerged as a promising research
area, in which artificial intelligence (AI) plays a key role. To make AI models
practically applicable, it is required that the prediction results should be
both accurate and interpretable. To achieve this goal, this paper proposed a
label-dependent and event-guided risk prediction model (LERP) to predict the
presence of multiple disease risks by mainly extracting information from
unstructured medical notes. Our model is featured in the following aspects.
First, we adopt a label-dependent mechanism that gives greater attention to
words from medical notes that are semantically similar to the names of risk
labels. Secondly, as the clinical events (e.g., treatments and drugs) can also
indicate the health status of patients, our model utilizes the information from
events and uses them to generate an event-guided representation of medical
notes. Thirdly, both label-dependent and event-guided representations are
integrated to make a robust prediction, in which the interpretability is
enabled by the attention weights over words from medical notes. To demonstrate
the applicability of the proposed method, we apply it to the MIMIC-III dataset,
which contains real-world EHRs collected from hospitals. Our method is
evaluated in both quantitative and qualitative ways.",2022-01-18,2022,2022-01,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06783v1
"Benchmark datasets driving artificial intelligence development fail to
  capture the needs of medical professionals","Publicly accessible benchmarks that allow for assessing and comparing model
performances are important drivers of progress in artificial intelligence (AI).
While recent advances in AI capabilities hold the potential to transform
medical practice by assisting and augmenting the cognitive processes of
healthcare professionals, the coverage of clinically relevant tasks by AI
benchmarks is largely unclear. Furthermore, there is a lack of systematized
meta-information that allows clinical AI researchers to quickly determine
accessibility, scope, content and other characteristics of datasets and
benchmark datasets relevant to the clinical domain.
  To address these issues, we curated and released a comprehensive catalogue of
datasets and benchmarks pertaining to the broad domain of clinical and
biomedical natural language processing (NLP), based on a systematic review of
literature and online resources. A total of 450 NLP datasets were manually
systematized and annotated with rich metadata, such as targeted tasks, clinical
applicability, data types, performance metrics, accessibility and licensing
information, and availability of data splits. We then compared tasks covered by
AI benchmark datasets with relevant tasks that medical practitioners reported
as highly desirable targets for automation in a previous empirical study.
  Our analysis indicates that AI benchmarks of direct clinical relevance are
scarce and fail to cover most work activities that clinicians want to see
addressed. In particular, tasks associated with routine documentation and
patient data administration workflows are not represented despite significant
associated workloads. Thus, currently available AI benchmarks are improperly

Application of DatasetGAN in medical imaging: preliminary studies,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been widely investigated for many
potential applications in medical imaging. DatasetGAN is a recently proposed
framework based on modern GANs that can synthesize high-quality segmented

synthesized annotated images could be potentially employed for many medical
imaging applications, where images with segmentation information are required.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies focusing
on its applications to medical imaging. In this work, preliminary studies were
conducted to investigate the utility of DatasetGAN in medical imaging. Three
improvements were proposed to the original DatasetGAN framework, considering

"Evaluating Explainable AI on a Multi-Modal Medical Imaging Task: Can
  Existing Algorithms Fulfill Clinical Requirements?","Being able to explain the prediction to clinical end-users is a necessity to
leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) models for clinical decision
support. For medical images, a feature attribution map, or heatmap, is the most
common form of explanation that highlights important features for AI models'
prediction. However, it is unknown how well heatmaps perform on explaining
decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each image modality or channel
visualizes distinct clinical information of the same underlying biomedical
phenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for
clinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically
important but technically ignored problem, we propose the modality-specific
feature importance (MSFI) metric. It encodes clinical image and explanation
interpretation patterns of modality prioritization and modality-specific
feature localization. We conduct a clinical requirement-grounded, systematic
evaluation using computational methods and a clinician user study. Results show
that the examined 16 heatmap algorithms failed to fulfill clinical requirements
to correctly indicate AI model decision process or decision quality. The
evaluation and MSFI metric can guide the design and selection of XAI algorithms
to meet clinical requirements on multi-modal explanation.",2022-03-12,2022,2022-03,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06487v2
"Visual explanations for polyp detection: How medical doctors assess
  intrinsic versus extrinsic explanations","Deep learning has in recent years achieved immense success in all areas of
computer vision and has the potential of assisting medical doctors in analyzing
visual content for disease and other abnormalities. However, the current state
of deep learning is very much a black box, making medical professionals highly
skeptical about integrating these methods into clinical practice. Several
methods have been proposed in order to shine some light onto these black boxes,
but there is no consensus on the opinion of the medical doctors that will
consume these explanations. This paper presents a study asking medical doctors
about their opinion of current state-of-the-art explainable artificial
intelligence methods when applied to a gastrointestinal disease detection use
case. We compare two different categories of explanation methods, intrinsic and
extrinsic, and gauge their opinion of the current value of these explanations.

"Optimally Designing Cybersecurity Insurance Contracts to Encourage the
  Sharing of Medical Data","Though the sharing of medical data has the potential to lead to breakthroughs
in health care, the sharing process itself exposes patients and health care
providers to various risks. Patients face risks due to the possible loss in
privacy or livelihood that can occur when medical data is stolen or used in
non-permitted ways, whereas health care providers face risks due to the
associated liability. For medical data, these risks persist even after
anonymizing/deidentifying, according to the standards defined in existing
legislation, the data sets prior to sharing, because shared medical data can
often be deanonymized/reidentified using advanced artificial intelligence and
machine learning methodologies. As a result, health care providers are hesitant
to share medical data. One possible solution to encourage health care providers
to responsibly share data is through the use of cybersecurity insurance
contracts. This paper studies the problem of designing optimal cybersecurity
insurance contracts, with the goal of encouraging the sharing of the medical
data. We use a principal-agent model with moral hazard to model various
scenarios, derive the optimal contract, discuss its implications, and perform
numerical case studies. In particular, we consider two scenarios: the first
scenario is where a health care provider is selling medical data to a
technology firm who is developing an artificial intelligence algorithm using
the shared data. The second scenario is where a group of health care providers
share health data amongst themselves for the purpose of furthering medical
research using the aggregated medical data.",2022-04-13,2022,2022-04,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06549v2

improve the efficiency of healthcare, especially during the pandemic. This
paper presents a medical conversational question answering (CQA) system based
on the multi-modal knowledge graph, namely ""LingYi"", which is designed as a

"KnowAugNet: Multi-Source Medical Knowledge Augmented Medication
  Prediction Network with Multi-Level Graph Contrastive Learning","Predicting medications is a crucial task in many intelligent healthcare
systems. It can assist doctors in making informed medication decisions for
patients according to electronic medical records (EMRs). However, medication
prediction is a challenging data mining task due to the complex relations
between medical codes. Most existing studies focus on utilizing inherent
relations between homogeneous codes of medical ontology graph to enhance their
representations using supervised methods, and few studies pay attention to the
valuable relations between heterogeneous or homogeneous medical codes from
history EMRs, which further limits the prediction performance and application
scenarios. Therefore, to address these limitations, this paper proposes
KnowAugNet, a multi-sourced medical knowledge augmented medication prediction
network which can fully capture the diverse relations between medical codes via
multi-level graph contrastive learning framework. Specifically, KnowAugNet
first leverages the graph contrastive learning using graph attention network as
the encoder to capture the implicit relations between homogeneous medical codes
from the medical ontology graph and obtains the knowledge augmented medical
codes embedding vectors. Then, it utilizes the graph contrastive learning using
a weighted graph convolutional network as the encoder to capture the
correlative relations between homogeneous or heterogeneous medical codes from
the constructed medical prior relation graph and obtains the relation augmented
medical codes embedding vectors. Finally, the augmented medical codes embedding
vectors and the supervised medical codes embedding vectors are retrieved and
input to the sequential learning network to capture the temporal relations of
medical codes and predict medications for patients.",2022-04-25,2022,2022-04,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11736v2
"CATNet: Cross-event Attention-based Time-aware Network for Medical Event
  Prediction","Medical event prediction (MEP) is a fundamental task in the medical domain,
which needs to predict medical events, including medications, diagnosis codes,
laboratory tests, procedures, outcomes, and so on, according to historical
medical records. The task is challenging as medical data is a type of complex
time series data with heterogeneous and temporal irregular characteristics.
Many machine learning methods that consider the two characteristics have been
proposed for medical event prediction. However, most of them consider the two
characteristics separately and ignore the correlations among different types of
medical events, especially relations between historical medical events and
target medical events. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based
on attention mechanism, called cross-event attention-based time-aware network
(CATNet), for medical event prediction. It is a time-aware, event-aware and
task-adaptive method with the following advantages: 1) modeling heterogeneous
information and temporal information in a unified way and considering temporal
irregular characteristics locally and globally respectively, 2) taking full
advantage of correlations among different types of events via cross-event
attention. Experiments on two public datasets (MIMIC-III and eICU) show CATNet
can be adaptive with different MEP tasks and outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods on various MEP tasks. The source code of CATNet will be released after
this manuscript is accepted.",2022-04-29,2022,2022-04,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13847v1
"Explainable Deep Learning Methods in Medical Image Classification: A
  Survey","The remarkable success of deep learning has prompted interest in its
application to medical imaging diagnosis. Even though state-of-the-art deep
learning models have achieved human-level accuracy on the classification of
different types of medical data, these models are hardly adopted in clinical
workflows, mainly due to their lack of interpretability. The black-box-ness of
deep learning models has raised the need for devising strategies to explain the
decision process of these models, leading to the creation of the topic of
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this context, we provide a
thorough survey of XAI applied to medical imaging diagnosis, including visual,
textual, example-based and concept-based explanation methods. Moreover, this
work reviews the existing medical imaging datasets and the existing metrics for

Robust and Efficient Medical Imaging with Self-Supervision,"Recent progress in Medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) has delivered systems
that can reach clinical expert level performance. However, such systems tend to
demonstrate sub-optimal ""out-of-distribution"" performance when evaluated in
clinical settings different from the training environment. A common mitigation
strategy is to develop separate systems for each clinical setting using
site-specific data [1]. However, this quickly becomes impractical as medical
data is time-consuming to acquire and expensive to annotate [2]. Thus, the
problem of ""data-efficient generalization"" presents an ongoing difficulty for
Medical AI development. Although progress in representation learning shows
promise, their benefits have not been rigorously studied, specifically for
out-of-distribution settings. To meet these challenges, we present REMEDIS, a
unified representation learning strategy to improve robustness and
data-efficiency of medical imaging AI. REMEDIS uses a generic combination of
large-scale supervised transfer learning with self-supervised learning and
requires little task-specific customization. We study a diverse range of
medical imaging tasks and simulate three realistic application scenarios using
retrospective data. REMEDIS exhibits significantly improved in-distribution
performance with up to 11.5% relative improvement in diagnostic accuracy over a
strong supervised baseline. More importantly, our strategy leads to strong
data-efficient generalization of medical imaging AI, matching strong supervised
baselines using between 1% to 33% of retraining data across tasks. These
results suggest that REMEDIS can significantly accelerate the life-cycle of
medical imaging AI development thereby presenting an important step forward for
medical imaging AI to deliver broad impact.",2022-05-19,2022,2022-05,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09723v2

in order to quantify the cardiac biventricular function (volume, mass, and EF).
To analyze its robustness in the clinical area, and the computational times

Future Artificial Intelligence tools and perspectives in medicine,"Purpose of review: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become popular in medical
applications, specifically as a clinical support tool for computer-aided

molecular data, clinical variables, etc.) and used the statistical and machine
learning methods to measure the model performance. In this review, we
summarized and discussed the most recent radiomic pipeline used for clinical
analysis. Recent findings:Currently, limited management of cancers benefits
from artificial intelligence, mostly related to a computer-aided diagnosis that
avoids a biopsy analysis that presents additional risks and costs. Most AI

"Improving Medical Systems in the United States using Knowledge-Based
  Systems","America has one of the best medical systems in the world. The medical
treatment care options offered by the medical system make it sophisticated.
However, many American patients are not receiving health care on a regular
basis, and at the same time, they cannot afford it. Also, the current medical
system has many flaws such as high medical treatment costs and lack of doctors
to accommodate many patients. This paper presents the principles of medical
artificial intelligence called the knowledge based system. Doctors can remotely
check and monitor their patients health data, medical history, how and what
medical tests were done, and the lab results. The patients have access to
detailed health information online and do not need to make an appointment with
doctors to check their health on a daily basis. One doctor can check many
patients simultaneously online (when medical centers are understaffed) and do
not need to spend a lot of time with patients. Thus, doctors save more money
for patients, because patients will no longer be transporting to medical
centers to receive routine health check-ups. Patients do not need to overpay
for their insurance because they will have access to the knowledge-based
system, and the system will save the patients money to have their health
checked and reduce the number of unnecessary medical exams. This paper
undertakes a brief overview of research work done in a knowledge based system

performance and robustness. In this paper we analyze machine learning for
medical image analysis within the framework of Technology Readiness Levels and
review how causal analysis methods can fill a gap when creating robust and

Medical Dialogue Response Generation with Pivotal Information Recalling,"Medical dialogue generation is an important yet challenging task. Most
previous works rely on the attention mechanism and large-scale pretrained
language models. However, these methods often fail to acquire pivotal
information from the long dialogue history to yield an accurate and informative
response, due to the fact that the medical entities usually scatters throughout
multiple utterances along with the complex relationships between them. To
mitigate this problem, we propose a medical response generation model with
Pivotal Information Recalling (MedPIR), which is built on two components, i.e.,
knowledge-aware dialogue graph encoder and recall-enhanced generator. The
knowledge-aware dialogue graph encoder constructs a dialogue graph by
exploiting the knowledge relationships between entities in the utterances, and
encodes it with a graph attention network. Then, the recall-enhanced generator
strengthens the usage of these pivotal information by generating a summary of
the dialogue before producing the actual response. Experimental results on two
large-scale medical dialogue datasets show that MedPIR outperforms the strong
baselines in BLEU scores and medical entities F1 measure.",2022-06-17,2022,2022-06,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08611v1

a simple autoencoder-based preprocessing method that can correct mixed-type
tabular data corrupted by attribute noise. No other method currently exists to
handle attribute noise in tabular data. We experimentally demonstrate that our

Radiologists continue to face multiple challenges in today's rapidly evolving

Although there are some conventional methods for lung cancer detection before,

efficient transformer and applies it to medical image analysis. The algorithm
completes the task of lung cancer classification and segmentation by analyzing
lung cancer data, and aims to provide efficient technical support for medical

For the classification mission, the max accuracy of Swin-T by regular training
and Swin-B in two resolutions by pre-training can be up to 82.3%. For the
segmentation mission, we use pre-training to help the model improve the

"A hybrid Bayesian network for medical device risk assessment and

"Declarative Guideline Conformance Checking of Clinical Treatments: A
  Case Study","Conformance checking is a process mining technique that allows verifying the
conformance of process instances to a given model. Thus, this technique is
predestined to be used in the medical context for the comparison of treatment
cases with clinical guidelines. However, medical processes are highly variable,
highly dynamic, and complex. This makes the use of imperative conformance
checking approaches in the medical domain difficult. Studies show that
declarative approaches can better address these characteristics. However, none
of the approaches has yet gained practical acceptance. Another challenge are
alignments, which usually do not add any value from a medical point of view.
For this reason, we investigate in a case study the usability of the HL7
standard Arden Syntax for declarative, rule-based conformance checking and the

"Artificial Intelligence-Based Image Reconstruction in Cardiac Magnetic
  Resonance","Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have shown great
potential in improving the medical imaging workflow, from image acquisition and
reconstruction to disease diagnosis and treatment. Particularly, in recent
years, there has been a significant growth in the use of AI and ML algorithms,
especially Deep Learning (DL) based methods, for medical image reconstruction.
DL techniques have shown to be competitive and often superior over conventional
reconstruction methods in terms of both reconstruction quality and
computational efficiency. The use of DL-based image reconstruction also
provides promising opportunities to transform the way cardiac images are
acquired and reconstructed. In this chapter, we will review recent advances in
DL-based reconstruction techniques for cardiac imaging, with emphasis on
cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image reconstruction. We mainly focus on
supervised DL methods for the application, including image post-processing
techniques, model-driven approaches and k-space based methods. Current
limitations, challenges and future opportunities of DL for cardiac image
reconstruction are also discussed.",2022-09-21,2022,2022-09,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10298v1
"DR.BENCH: Diagnostic Reasoning Benchmark for Clinical Natural Language
  Processing","The meaningful use of electronic health records (EHR) continues to progress
in the digital era with clinical decision support systems augmented by
artificial intelligence. A priority in improving provider experience is to
overcome information overload and reduce the cognitive burden so fewer medical
errors and cognitive biases are introduced during patient care. One major type
of medical error is diagnostic error due to systematic or predictable errors in
judgment that rely on heuristics. The potential for clinical natural language
processing (cNLP) to model diagnostic reasoning in humans with forward
reasoning from data to diagnosis and potentially reduce the cognitive burden
and medical error has not been investigated. Existing tasks to advance the
science in cNLP have largely focused on information extraction and named entity
recognition through classification tasks. We introduce a novel suite of tasks
coined as Diagnostic Reasoning Benchmarks, DR.BENCH, as a new benchmark for
developing and evaluating cNLP models with clinical diagnostic reasoning
ability. The suite includes six tasks from ten publicly available datasets
addressing clinical text understanding, medical knowledge reasoning, and
diagnosis generation. DR.BENCH is the first clinical suite of tasks designed to
be a natural language generation framework to evaluate pre-trained language
models. Experiments with state-of-the-art pre-trained generative language
models using large general domain models and models that were continually
trained on a medical corpus demonstrate opportunities for improvement when
evaluated in DR. BENCH. We share DR. BENCH as a publicly available GitLab
repository with a systematic approach to load and evaluate models for the cNLP
community.",2022-09-29,2022,2022-09,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14901v2
"Compressed Gastric Image Generation Based on Soft-Label Dataset
  Distillation for Medical Data Sharing","Background and objective: Sharing of medical data is required to enable the
cross-agency flow of healthcare information and construct high-accuracy
computer-aided diagnosis systems. However, the large sizes of medical datasets,
the massive amount of memory of saved deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)
models, and patients' privacy protection are problems that can lead to
inefficient medical data sharing. Therefore, this study proposes a novel
soft-label dataset distillation method for medical data sharing.
  Methods: The proposed method distills valid information of medical image data
and generates several compressed images with different data distributions for
anonymous medical data sharing. Furthermore, our method can extract essential
weights of DCNN models to reduce the memory required to save trained models for
efficient medical data sharing.
  Results: The proposed method can compress tens of thousands of images into
several soft-label images and reduce the size of a trained model to a few
hundredths of its original size. The compressed images obtained after
distillation have been visually anonymized; therefore, they do not contain the
private information of the patients. Furthermore, we can realize high-detection
performance with a small number of compressed images.
  Conclusions: The experimental results show that the proposed method can
improve the efficiency and security of medical data sharing.",2022-09-29,2022,2022-09,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14635v2
"Medical Image Retrieval via Nearest Neighbor Search on Pre-trained Image
  Features","Nearest neighbor search (NNS) aims to locate the points in high-dimensional
space that is closest to the query point. The brute-force approach for finding
the nearest neighbor becomes computationally infeasible when the number of
points is large. The NNS has multiple applications in medicine, such as
searching large medical imaging databases, disease classification, diagnosis,
etc. With a focus on medical imaging, this paper proposes DenseLinkSearch an
effective and efficient algorithm that searches and retrieves the relevant
images from heterogeneous sources of medical images. Towards this, given a
medical database, the proposed algorithm builds the index that consists of
pre-computed links of each point in the database. The search algorithm utilizes
the index to efficiently traverse the database in search of the nearest
neighbor. We extensively tested the proposed NNS approach and compared the
performance with state-of-the-art NNS approaches on benchmark datasets and our
created medical image datasets. The proposed approach outperformed the existing
approach in terms of retrieving accurate neighbors and retrieval speed. We also
explore the role of medical image feature representation in content-based
medical image retrieval tasks. We propose a Transformer-based feature
representation technique that outperformed the existing pre-trained Transformer
approach on CLEF 2011 medical image retrieval task. The source code of our

"KG-MTT-BERT: Knowledge Graph Enhanced BERT for Multi-Type Medical Text
  Classification","Medical text learning has recently emerged as a promising area to improve
healthcare due to the wide adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems.
The complexity of the medical text such as diverse length, mixed text types,
and full of medical jargon, poses a great challenge for developing effective
deep learning models. BERT has presented state-of-the-art results in many NLP
tasks, such as text classification and question answering. However, the
standalone BERT model cannot deal with the complexity of the medical text,
especially the lengthy clinical notes. Herein, we develop a new model called
KG-MTT-BERT (Knowledge Graph Enhanced Multi-Type Text BERT) by extending the
BERT model for long and multi-type text with the integration of the medical
knowledge graph. Our model can outperform all baselines and other
state-of-the-art models in diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification, which
requires comprehensive medical text for accurate classification. We also

"Multi-Granularity Cross-modal Alignment for Generalized Medical Visual
  Representation Learning","Learning medical visual representations directly from paired radiology
reports has become an emerging topic in representation learning. However,
existing medical image-text joint learning methods are limited by instance or
local supervision analysis, ignoring disease-level semantic correspondences. In
this paper, we present a novel Multi-Granularity Cross-modal Alignment (MGCA)
framework for generalized medical visual representation learning by harnessing
the naturally exhibited semantic correspondences between medical image and
radiology reports at three different levels, i.e., pathological region-level,
instance-level, and disease-level. Specifically, we first incorporate the
instance-wise alignment module by maximizing the agreement between image-report
pairs. Further, for token-wise alignment, we introduce a bidirectional
cross-attention strategy to explicitly learn the matching between fine-grained
visual tokens and text tokens, followed by contrastive learning to align them.
More important, to leverage the high-level inter-subject relationship semantic
(e.g., disease) correspondences, we design a novel cross-modal disease-level
alignment paradigm to enforce the cross-modal cluster assignment consistency.
Extensive experimental results on seven downstream medical image datasets
covering image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation
tasks demonstrate the stable and superior performance of our framework.",2022-10-12,2022,2022-10,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06044v1

"Spot the fake lungs: Generating Synthetic Medical Images using Neural
  Diffusion Models","Generative models are becoming popular for the synthesis of medical images.
Recently, neural diffusion models have demonstrated the potential to generate
photo-realistic images of objects. However, their potential to generate medical
images is not explored yet. In this work, we explore the possibilities of
synthesis of medical images using neural diffusion models. First, we use a
pre-trained DALLE2 model to generate lungs X-Ray and CT images from an input
text prompt. Second, we train a stable diffusion model with 3165 X-Ray images
and generate synthetic images. We evaluate the synthetic image data through a
qualitative analysis where two independent radiologists label randomly chosen
samples from the generated data as real, fake, or unsure. Results demonstrate
that images generated with the diffusion model can translate characteristics
that are otherwise very specific to certain medical conditions in chest X-Ray
or CT images. Careful tuning of the model can be very promising. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate lungs X-Ray and CT images
using neural diffusion models. This work aims to introduce a new dimension in
artificial intelligence for medical imaging. Given that this is a new topic,
the paper will serve as an introduction and motivation for the research
community to explore the potential of diffusion models for medical image

Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Multi-modal Medical Data Analysis,"Routine clinical visits of a patient produce not only image data, but also
non-image data containing clinical information regarding the patient, i.e.,
medical data is multi-modal in nature. Such heterogeneous modalities offer
different and complementary perspectives on the same patient, resulting in more
accurate clinical decisions when they are properly combined. However, despite
its significance, how to effectively fuse the multi-modal medical data into a
unified framework has received relatively little attention. In this paper, we
propose an effective graph-based framework called HetMed (Heterogeneous Graph
Learning for Multi-modal Medical Data Analysis) for fusing the multi-modal
medical data. Specifically, we construct a multiplex network that incorporates
multiple types of non-image features of patients to capture the complex
relationship between patients in a systematic way, which leads to more accurate

"Analysis of Explainable Artificial Intelligence Methods on Medical Image
  Classification","The use of deep learning in computer vision tasks such as image
classification has led to a rapid increase in the performance of such systems.
Due to this substantial increment in the utility of these systems, the use of

high accuracy and near parity with human physicians in many tasks. However,
these artificial intelligence systems are extremely complex and are considered
black boxes by scientists, due to the difficulty in interpreting what exactly

"Annotation by Clicks: A Point-Supervised Contrastive Variance Method for
  Medical Semantic Segmentation","Medical image segmentation methods typically rely on numerous dense annotated
images for model training, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming
to collect. To alleviate this burden, weakly supervised techniques have been
exploited to train segmentation models with less expensive annotations. In this
paper, we propose a novel point-supervised contrastive variance method (PSCV)
for medical image semantic segmentation, which only requires one pixel-point
from each organ category to be annotated. The proposed method trains the base
segmentation network by using a novel contrastive variance (CV) loss to exploit
the unlabeled pixels and a partial cross-entropy loss on the labeled pixels.
The CV loss function is designed to exploit the statistical spatial
distribution properties of organs in medical images and their variance
distribution map representations to enforce discriminative predictions over the
unlabeled pixels. Experimental results on two standard medical image datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly

"Artificial Intelligence Model for Tumoral Clinical Decision Support
  Systems","Comparative diagnostic in brain tumor evaluation makes possible to use the
available information of a medical center to compare similar cases when a new
patient is evaluated. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence models, the
proposed system is able of retrieving the most similar cases of brain tumors
for a given query. The primary objective is to enhance the diagnostic process
by generating more accurate representations of medical images, with a
particular focus on patient-specific normal features and pathologies. The
proposed model uses Artificial Intelligence to detect patient features to
recommend the most similar cases from a database. The system not only suggests
similar cases but also balances the representation of healthy and abnormal
features in its design. This not only encourages the generalization of its use
but also aids clinicians in their decision-making processes. We conducted a
comparative analysis of our approach in relation to similar studies. The
proposed architecture obtains a Dice coefficient of 0.474 in both tumoral and
healthy regions of the patients, which outperforms previous literature. Our
proposed model excels at extracting and combining anatomical and pathological
features from brain \glspl{mr}, achieving state-of-the-art results while
relying on less expensive label information. This substantially reduces the
overall cost of the training process. This paper provides substantial grounds
for further exploration of the broader applicability and optimization of the
proposed architecture to enhance clinical decision-making. The novel approach
presented in this work marks a significant advancement in the field of medical

Multimodal Information Fusion For The Diagnosis Of Diabetic Retinopathy,"Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by excess sugar in the blood and
affects 422 million people worldwide, including 3.3 million in France. One of
the frequent complications of diabetes is diabetic retinopathy (DR): it is the
leading cause of blindness in the working population of developed countries. As
a result, ophthalmology is on the verge of a revolution in screening,
diagnosing, and managing of pathologies. This upheaval is led by the arrival of
technologies based on artificial intelligence. The ""Evaluation intelligente de
la r\'etinopathie diab\'etique"" (EviRed) project uses artificial intelligence
to answer a medical need: replacing the current classification of diabetic
retinopathy which is mainly based on outdated fundus photography and providing
an insufficient prediction precision. EviRed exploits modern fundus imaging
devices and artificial intelligence to properly integrate the vast amount of
data they provide with other available medical data of the patient. The goal is
to improve diagnosis and prediction and help ophthalmologists to make better
decisions during diabetic retinopathy follow-up. In this study, we investigate
the fusion of different modalities acquired simultaneously with a PLEXElite

"Implicit Anatomical Rendering for Medical Image Segmentation with
  Stochastic Experts","Integrating high-level semantically correlated contents and low-level
anatomical features is of central importance in medical image segmentation.
Towards this end, recent deep learning-based medical segmentation methods have
shown great promise in better modeling such information. However, convolution
operators for medical segmentation typically operate on regular grids, which
inherently blur the high-frequency regions, i.e., boundary regions. In this
work, we propose MORSE, a generic implicit neural rendering framework designed
at an anatomical level to assist learning in medical image segmentation. Our
method is motivated by the fact that implicit neural representation has been
shown to be more effective in fitting complex signals and solving computer
graphics problems than discrete grid-based representation. The core of our
approach is to formulate medical image segmentation as a rendering problem in
an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we continuously align the coarse
segmentation prediction with the ambiguous coordinate-based point
representations and aggregate these features to adaptively refine the boundary
region. To parallelly optimize multi-scale pixel-level features, we leverage
the idea from Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) to design and train our MORSE with a
stochastic gating mechanism. Our experiments demonstrate that MORSE can work
well with different medical segmentation backbones, consistently achieving
competitive performance improvements in both 2D and 3D supervised medical
segmentation methods. We also theoretically analyze the superiority of MORSE.",2023-04-06,2023,2023-04,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03209v2

Differentiate ChatGPT-generated and Human-written Medical Texts,"Background: Large language models such as ChatGPT are capable of generating
grammatically perfect and human-like text content, and a large number of
ChatGPT-generated texts have appeared on the Internet. However, medical texts
such as clinical notes and diagnoses require rigorous validation, and erroneous
medical content generated by ChatGPT could potentially lead to disinformation
that poses significant harm to healthcare and the general public.
  Objective: This research is among the first studies on responsible and
ethical AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) in medicine. We focus
on analyzing the differences between medical texts written by human experts and
generated by ChatGPT, and designing machine learning workflows to effectively
detect and differentiate medical texts generated by ChatGPT.
  Methods: We first construct a suite of datasets containing medical texts
written by human experts and generated by ChatGPT. In the next step, we analyze
the linguistic features of these two types of content and uncover differences
in vocabulary, part-of-speech, dependency, sentiment, perplexity, etc. Finally,
we design and implement machine learning methods to detect medical text
generated by ChatGPT.
  Results: Medical texts written by humans are more concrete, more diverse, and
typically contain more useful information, while medical texts generated by
ChatGPT pay more attention to fluency and logic, and usually express general
terminologies rather than effective information specific to the context of the

"Towards Medical Artificial General Intelligence via Knowledge-Enhanced
  Multimodal Pretraining","Medical artificial general intelligence (MAGI) enables one foundation model
to solve different medical tasks, which is very practical in the medical
domain. It can significantly reduce the requirement of large amounts of
task-specific data by sufficiently sharing medical knowledge among different
tasks. However, due to the challenges of designing strongly generalizable
models with limited and complex medical data, most existing approaches tend to
develop task-specific models. To take a step towards MAGI, we propose a new
paradigm called Medical-knOwledge-enhanced mulTimOdal pretRaining (MOTOR). In
MOTOR, we combine two kinds of basic medical knowledge, i.e., general and
specific knowledge, in a complementary manner to boost the general pretraining
process. As a result, the foundation model with comprehensive basic knowledge
can learn compact representations from pretraining radiographic data for better
cross-modal alignment. MOTOR unifies the understanding and generation, which
are two kinds of core intelligence of an AI system, into a single medical
foundation model, to flexibly handle more diverse medical tasks. To enable a
comprehensive evaluation and facilitate further research, we construct a
medical multimodal benchmark including a wide range of downstream tasks, such
as chest x-ray report generation and medical visual question answering.
Extensive experiments on our benchmark show that MOTOR obtains promising
results through simple task-oriented adaptation. The visualization shows that
the injected knowledge successfully highlights key information in the medical
data, demonstrating the excellent interpretability of MOTOR. Our MOTOR
successfully mimics the human practice of fulfilling a ""medical student"" to

"Generating medically-accurate summaries of patient-provider dialogue: A
  multi-stage approach using large language models","A medical provider's summary of a patient visit serves several critical
purposes, including clinical decision-making, facilitating hand-offs between
providers, and as a reference for the patient. An effective summary is required
to be coherent and accurately capture all the medically relevant information in
the dialogue, despite the complexity of patient-generated language. Even minor
inaccuracies in visit summaries (for example, summarizing ""patient does not
have a fever"" when a fever is present) can be detrimental to the outcome of
care for the patient.
  This paper tackles the problem of medical conversation summarization by
discretizing the task into several smaller dialogue-understanding tasks that
are sequentially built upon. First, we identify medical entities and their
affirmations within the conversation to serve as building blocks. We study
dynamically constructing few-shot prompts for tasks by conditioning on relevant
patient information and use GPT-3 as the backbone for our experiments. We also
develop GPT-derived summarization metrics to measure performance against
reference summaries quantitatively. Both our human evaluation study and metrics
for medical correctness show that summaries generated using this approach are

challenges"" ranging from Go to protein-folding. The capability to retrieve
medical knowledge, reason over it, and answer medical questions comparably to
physicians has long been viewed as one such grand challenge.
  Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant progress in medical
question answering; Med-PaLM was the first model to exceed a ""passing"" score in
US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) style questions with a score of 67.2%
on the MedQA dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested significant
room for improvement, especially when models' answers were compared to
clinicians' answers. Here we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps by
leveraging a combination of base LLM improvements (PaLM 2), medical domain
finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble refinement
approach.
  Med-PaLM 2 scored up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM
by over 19% and setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance
approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art across MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU

Medical Dialogue Generation via Dual Flow Modeling,"Medical dialogue systems (MDS) aim to provide patients with medical services,

Previous studies mainly addressed this by extracting the mentioned medical

it is also essential to capture the transitions of the medical entities and the
doctor's dialogue acts in each turn, as they help the understanding of how the
dialogue flows and enhance the prediction of the entities and dialogue acts to
be adopted in the following turn. Correspondingly, we propose a Dual Flow
enhanced Medical (DFMed) dialogue generation framework. It extracts the medical
entities and dialogue acts used in the dialogue history and models their

"Med-UniC: Unifying Cross-Lingual Medical Vision-Language Pre-Training by
  Diminishing Bias","The scarcity of data presents a critical obstacle to the efficacy of medical
visionlanguage pre-training (VLP). A potential solution lies in the combination
of datasets from various language communities. Nevertheless, the main challenge
stems from the complexity of integrating diverse syntax and semantics,
language-specific medical terminology, and culture-specific implicit knowledge.
Therefore, one crucial aspect to consider is the presence of community bias
caused by different languages. This paper presents a novel framework named
Unifying Cross-Lingual Medical Vision-Language Pre-Training (Med-UniC),
designed to integrate multimodal medical data from the two most prevalent
languages, English and Spanish. Specifically, we propose Cross-lingual Text
Alignment Regularization (CTR) to explicitly unify cross-lingual semantic
representations of medical reports originating from diverse language
communities. CTR is optimized through latent language disentanglement,
rendering our optimization objective to not depend on negative samples, thereby
significantly mitigating the bias from determining positive-negative sample
pairs within analogous medical reports. Furthermore, it ensures that the
cross-lingual representation is not biased toward any specific language
community. Med-UniC reaches superior performance across 5 medical image tasks
and 10 datasets encompassing over 30 diseases, offering a versatile framework
for unifying multi-modal medical data within diverse linguistic communities.
The experimental outcomes highlight the presence of community bias in
cross-lingual VLP. Reducing this bias enhances the performance not only in

Specifically, GTGM utilizes large language models (LLM) to generate

supervise 3D visual representation learning. Furthermore, a negative-free
contrastive learning objective strategy is introduced to cultivate consistent
visual representations between augmented 3D medical image patches, which
effectively mitigates the biases associated with strict positive-negative

"Masked Vision and Language Pre-training with Unimodal and Multimodal
  Contrastive Losses for Medical Visual Question Answering","Medical visual question answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires
answering clinical questions of a given medical image, by taking consider of
both visual and language information. However, due to the small scale of
training data for medical VQA, pre-training fine-tuning paradigms have been a
commonly used solution to improve model generalization performance. In this
paper, we present a novel self-supervised approach that learns unimodal and
multimodal feature representations of input images and text using medical image
caption datasets, by leveraging both unimodal and multimodal contrastive
losses, along with masked language modeling and image text matching as
pretraining objectives. The pre-trained model is then transferred to downstream
medical VQA tasks. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on three publicly available medical VQA datasets with significant
accuracy improvements of 2.2%, 14.7%, and 1.7% respectively. Besides, we
conduct a comprehensive analysis to validate the effectiveness of different

from medical imaging and clinical text. However, these models are not easy to

novel way for pre-training and regularising medical vision-language models. The
proposed method, named Medical vision-language pre-training with Frozen

frozen language model for training stability and efficiency and introduces a
novel orthogonality loss to harmonize the latent space geometry. We demonstrate
the potential of the pre-trained model on three downstream tasks: medical image
classification, segmentation, and object detection. Extensive experiments
across five public datasets demonstrate that M-FLAG significantly outperforms
existing medical vision-language pre-training approaches and reduces the number
of parameters by 78\%. Notably, M-FLAG achieves outstanding performance on the
segmentation task while using only 1\% of the RSNA dataset, even outperforming

"Balancing Privacy and Progress in Artificial Intelligence: Anonymization
  in Histopathology for Biomedical Research and Education","The advancement of biomedical research heavily relies on access to large
amounts of medical data. In the case of histopathology, Whole Slide Images
(WSI) and clinicopathological information are valuable for developing
Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Digital Pathology (DP).
Transferring medical data ""as open as possible"" enhances the usability of the
data for secondary purposes but poses a risk to patient privacy. At the same
time, existing regulations push towards keeping medical data ""as closed as
necessary"" to avoid re-identification risks. Generally, these legal regulations
require the removal of sensitive data but do not consider the possibility of
data linkage attacks due to modern image-matching algorithms. In addition, the
lack of standardization in DP makes it harder to establish a single solution
for all formats of WSIs. These challenges raise problems for bio-informatics
researchers in balancing privacy and progress while developing AI algorithms.
This paper explores the legal regulations and terminologies for medical
data-sharing. We review existing approaches and highlight challenges from the

Med-Flamingo: a Multimodal Medical Few-shot Learner,"Medicine, by its nature, is a multifaceted domain that requires the synthesis
of information across various modalities. Medical generative vision-language

clinical applications. However, existing models typically have to be fine-tuned
on sizeable down-stream datasets, which poses a significant limitation as in
many medical applications data is scarce, necessitating models that are capable
of learning from few examples in real-time. Here we propose Med-Flamingo, a
multimodal few-shot learner adapted to the medical domain. Based on
OpenFlamingo-9B, we continue pre-training on paired and interleaved medical
image-text data from publications and textbooks. Med-Flamingo unlocks few-shot
generative medical visual question answering (VQA) abilities, which we evaluate
on several datasets including a novel challenging open-ended VQA dataset of
visual USMLE-style problems. Furthermore, we conduct the first human evaluation
for generative medical VQA where physicians review the problems and blinded

"From Military to Healthcare: Adopting and Expanding Ethical Principles
  for Generative Artificial Intelligence","In 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense officially disclosed a set of ethical
principles to guide the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies on
future battlefields. Despite stark differences, there are core similarities
between the military and medical service. Warriors on battlefields often face
life-altering circumstances that require quick decision-making. Medical
providers experience similar challenges in a rapidly changing healthcare
environment, such as in the emergency department or during surgery treating a
life-threatening condition. Generative AI, an emerging technology designed to
efficiently generate valuable information, holds great promise. As computing
power becomes more accessible and the abundance of health data, such as
electronic health records, electrocardiograms, and medical images, increases,
it is inevitable that healthcare will be revolutionized by this technology.
Recently, generative AI has captivated the research community, leading to
debates about its application in healthcare, mainly due to concerns about
transparency and related issues. Meanwhile, concerns about the potential
exacerbation of health disparities due to modeling biases have raised notable
ethical concerns regarding the use of this technology in healthcare. However,
the ethical principles for generative AI in healthcare have been understudied,
and decision-makers often fail to consider the significance of generative AI.
In this paper, we propose GREAT PLEA ethical principles, encompassing

gaining wide acceptance, the expertise, time and cost required to generate
annotated data in the medical field are significantly high, due to limited
availability of both data and expert annotation. Strongly supervised object
localization models require data that is exhaustively annotated, meaning all
objects of interest in an image are identified. This is difficult to achieve
and verify for medical images. We present a method for the transformation of
real data to train any Deep Neural Network to solve the above problems. We show
the efficacy of this approach on both a weakly supervised localization model
and a strongly supervised localization model. For the weakly supervised model,
we show that the localization accuracy increases significantly using the
generated data. For the strongly supervised model, this approach overcomes the
need for exhaustive annotation on real images. In the latter model, we show
that the accuracy, when trained with generated images, closely parallels the
accuracy when trained with exhaustively annotated real images. The results are
demonstrated on images of human urine samples obtained using microscopy.",2023-08-09,2023,2023-08,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04687v1

"StratMed: Relevance Stratification between Biomedical Entities for
  Sparsity on Medication Recommendation","With the growing imbalance between limited medical resources and escalating
demands, AI-based clinical tasks have become paramount. As a sub-domain,
medication recommendation aims to amalgamate longitudinal patient history with
medical knowledge, assisting physicians in prescribing safer and more accurate
medication combinations. Existing works ignore the inherent long-tailed
distribution of medical data, have uneven learning strengths for hot and sparse
data, and fail to balance safety and accuracy. To address the above
limitations, we propose StratMed, which introduces a stratification strategy
that overcomes the long-tailed problem and achieves fuller learning of sparse
data. It also utilizes a dual-property network to address the issue of mutual
constraints on the safety and accuracy of medication combinations,
synergistically enhancing these two properties. Specifically, we construct a
pre-training method using deep learning networks to obtain medication and
disease representations. After that, we design a pyramid-like stratification
method based on relevance to strengthen the expressiveness of sparse data.
Based on this relevance, we design two graph structures to express medication
safety and precision at the same level to obtain patient representations.
Finally, the patient's historical clinical information is fitted to generate
medication combinations for the current health condition. We employed the
MIMIC-III dataset to evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods in

"Towards objective and systematic evaluation of bias in artificial

efficacy of three bias mitigation strategies. The analysis revealed that the
simulated biases resulted in expected subgroup performance disparities when the
CNN was trained on the synthetic datasets. Moreover, reweighing was identified
as the most successful bias mitigation strategy for this setup, and we
demonstrated how explainable AI methods can aid in investigating the
manifestation of bias in the model using this framework. Developing fair AI
models is a considerable challenge given that many and often unknown sources of

"FaMeSumm: Investigating and Improving Faithfulness of Medical
  Summarization","Summaries of medical text shall be faithful by being consistent and factual
with source inputs, which is an important but understudied topic for safety and
efficiency in healthcare. In this paper, we investigate and improve
faithfulness in summarization on a broad range of medical summarization tasks.
Our investigation reveals that current summarization models often produce
unfaithful outputs for medical input text. We then introduce FaMeSumm, a
framework to improve faithfulness by fine-tuning pre-trained language models
based on medical knowledge. FaMeSumm performs contrastive learning on designed
sets of faithful and unfaithful summaries, and it incorporates medical terms
and their contexts to encourage faithful generation of medical terms. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on three datasets in two languages: health
question and radiology report summarization datasets in English, and a
patient-doctor dialogue dataset in Chinese. Results demonstrate that FaMeSumm
is flexible and effective by delivering consistent improvements over mainstream
language models such as BART, T5, mT5, and PEGASUS, yielding state-of-the-art
performances on metrics for faithfulness and general quality. Human evaluation
by doctors also shows that FaMeSumm generates more faithful outputs. Our code

accuracy of their responses is highly uncertain. In this research, we propose a
specialized PEFT-MedAware model where we utilize parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) to enhance the Falcon-1b large language model on specialized
MedQuAD data consisting of 16,407 medical QA pairs, leveraging only 0.44% of
its trainable parameters to enhance computational efficiency. The paper adopts
data preprocessing and PEFT to optimize model performance, complemented by a
BitsAndBytesConfig for efficient transformer training. The resulting model was
capable of outperforming other LLMs in medical question-answering tasks in
specific domains with greater accuracy utilizing limited computational
resources making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We propose further improvements through expanded datasets, larger
models, and feedback mechanisms for sustained medical relevancy. Our work
highlights the efficiency gains and specialized capabilities of PEFT in medical

  Million masks","Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved impressive results for natural
image segmentation with input prompts such as points and bounding boxes. Its
success largely owes to massive labeled training data. However, directly
applying SAM to medical image segmentation cannot perform well because SAM
lacks medical knowledge -- it does not use medical images for training. To
incorporate medical knowledge into SAM, we introduce SA-Med2D-20M, a
large-scale segmentation dataset of 2D medical images built upon numerous
public and private datasets. It consists of 4.6 million 2D medical images and
19.7 million corresponding masks, covering almost the whole body and showing
significant diversity. This paper describes all the datasets collected in
SA-Med2D-20M and details how to process these datasets. Furthermore,
comprehensive statistics of SA-Med2D-20M are presented to facilitate the better
use of our dataset, which can help the researchers build medical vision
foundation models or apply their models to downstream medical applications. We
hope that the large scale and diversity of SA-Med2D-20M can be leveraged to

  Efficient retrieval systems are crucial in advancing medical research,
enabling large-scale studies and innovative diagnostic tools. Thus, addressing
the challenges of medical image retrieval is essential for the continued

  In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of employing four
state-of-the-art pretrained models for medical image retrieval at modality,
body region, and organ levels and compared the results of two similarity
indexing approaches. Since the employed networks take 2D images, we analyzed
the impacts of weighting and sampling strategies to incorporate 3D information

medical reports based on transcripts of medical consultations. The aim is to
reduce the administrative burden that healthcare professionals face. The
accuracy of the generated reports needs to be established to ensure their

accuracy of AI generated reports, but little work has been done towards the
application of these metrics in medical reporting. A comparative
experimentation of 10 accuracy metrics has been performed on AI generated
medical reports against their corresponding General Practitioner's (GP) medical

"CMed-GPT: Prompt Tuning for Entity-Aware Chinese Medical Dialogue
  Generation","Medical dialogue generation relies on natural language generation techniques
to enable online medical consultations. Recently, the widespread adoption of
large-scale models in the field of natural language processing has facilitated
rapid advancements in this technology. Existing medical dialogue models are
mostly based on BERT and pre-trained on English corpora, but there is a lack of
high-performing models on the task of Chinese medical dialogue generation. To
solve the above problem, this paper proposes CMed-GPT, which is the GPT
pre-training language model based on Chinese medical domain text. The model is
available in two versions, namely, base and large, with corresponding
perplexity values of 8.64 and 8.01. Additionally, we incorporate lexical and
entity embeddings into the dialogue text in a uniform manner to meet the
requirements of downstream dialogue generation tasks. By applying both
fine-tuning and p-tuning to CMed-GPT, we lowered the PPL from 8.44 to 7.35.
This study not only confirms the exceptional performance of the CMed-GPT model
in generating Chinese biomedical text but also highlights the advantages of
p-tuning over traditional fine-tuning with prefix prompts. Furthermore, we
validate the significance of incorporating external information in medical
dialogue generation, which enhances the quality of dialogue generation.",2023-11-24,2023,2023-11,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14539v1
MEDITRON-70B: Scaling Medical Pretraining for Large Language Models,"Large language models (LLMs) can potentially democratize access to medical
knowledge. While many efforts have been made to harness and improve LLMs'
medical knowledge and reasoning capacities, the resulting models are either
closed-source (e.g., PaLM, GPT-4) or limited in scale (<= 13B parameters),
which restricts their abilities. In this work, we improve access to large-scale
medical LLMs by releasing MEDITRON: a suite of open-source LLMs with 7B and 70B
parameters adapted to the medical domain. MEDITRON builds on Llama-2 (through
our adaptation of Nvidia's Megatron-LM distributed trainer), and extends
pretraining on a comprehensively curated medical corpus, including selected
PubMed articles, abstracts, and internationally-recognized medical guidelines.
Evaluations using four major medical benchmarks show significant performance
gains over several state-of-the-art baselines before and after task-specific
finetuning. Overall, MEDITRON achieves a 6% absolute performance gain over the
best public baseline in its parameter class and 3% over the strongest baseline
we finetuned from Llama-2. Compared to closed-source LLMs, MEDITRON-70B
outperforms GPT-3.5 and Med-PaLM and is within 5% of GPT-4 and 10% of
Med-PaLM-2. We release our code for curating the medical pretraining corpus and

"Explanatory Argument Extraction of Correct Answers in Resident Medical
  Exams","Developing the required technology to assist medical experts in their
everyday activities is currently a hot topic in the Artificial Intelligence
research field. Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) and automated
benchmarks have recently been proposed with the aim of facilitating information
extraction in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) using natural language as a tool
for mediating in human-AI interaction. The most representative benchmarks are
limited to either multiple-choice or long-form answers and are available only
in English. In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present a
new dataset which, unlike previous work: (i) includes not only explanatory
arguments for the correct answer, but also arguments to reason why the
incorrect answers are not correct; (ii) the explanations are written originally
by medical doctors to answer questions from the Spanish Residency Medical
Exams. Furthermore, this new benchmark allows us to setup a novel extractive
task which consists of identifying the explanation of the correct answer
written by medical doctors. An additional benefit of our setting is that we can
leverage the extractive QA paradigm to automatically evaluate performance of
LLMs without resorting to costly manual evaluation by medical experts.
Comprehensive experimentation with language models for Spanish shows that
sometimes multilingual models fare better than monolingual ones, even
outperforming models which have been adapted to the medical domain.
Furthermore, results across the monolingual models are mixed, with supposedly
smaller and inferior models performing competitively. In any case, the obtained
results show that our novel dataset and approach can be an effective technique
to help medical practitioners in identifying relevant evidence-based
explanations for medical questions.",2023-12-01,2023,2023-12,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00567v1
From Beginner to Expert: Modeling Medical Knowledge into General LLMs,"Recently, large language model (LLM) based artificial intelligence (AI)
systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language
understanding and generation. However, these models face a significant
challenge when it comes to sensitive applications, such as reasoning over
medical knowledge and answering medical questions in a physician-like manner.
Prior studies attempted to overcome this challenge by increasing the model size
(>100B) to learn more general medical knowledge, while there is still room for
improvement in LLMs with smaller-scale model sizes (<100B). In this work, we
start from a pre-trained general LLM model (AntGLM-10B) and fine-tune it from a
medical beginner towards a medical expert (called AntGLM-Med-10B), which
leverages a 3-stage optimization procedure, i.e., general medical knowledge
injection, medical domain instruction tuning, and specific medical task
adaptation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We specifically investigate
how to adapt a pre-trained general LLM in medical domain, especially for a
specific medical task. (2) We collect and construct large-scale medical
datasets for each stage of the optimization process. These datasets encompass
various data types and tasks, such as question-answering, medical reasoning,
multi-choice questions, and medical conversations. (3) Specifically for
multi-choice questions in the medical domain, we propose a novel
Verification-of-Choice approach for prompting engineering, which significantly
enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Remarkably, by combining the above
approaches, our AntGLM-Med-10B model can outperform the most of LLMs on
PubMedQA, including both general and medical LLMs, even when these LLMs have
larger model size.",2023-12-02,2023,2023-12,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01040v3
"MKA: A Scalable Medical Knowledge Assisted Mechanism for Generative
  Models on Medical Conversation Tasks","Using natural language processing (NLP) technologies to develop medical
chatbots makes the diagnosis of the patient more convenient and efficient,

lots of research have been come out. Recently, the neural generative models

scale well when directly applied to medical conversation due to the lack of
medical-specific knowledge. To address the limitation, a scalable Medical
Knowledge Assisted mechanism, MKA, is proposed in this paper. The mechanism
aims to assist general neural generative models to achieve better performance
on the medical conversation task. The medical-specific knowledge graph is
designed within the mechanism, which contains 6 types of medical-related
information, including department, drug, check, symptom, disease, food.
Besides, the specific token concatenation policy is defined to effectively
inject medical information into the input data. Evaluation of our method is
carried out on two typical medical datasets, MedDG and MedDialog-CN. The
evaluation results demonstrate that models combined with our mechanism

The Limits of Fair Medical Imaging AI In The Wild,"As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly approaches human-level performance in
medical imaging, it is crucial that it does not exacerbate or propagate
healthcare disparities. Prior research has established AI's capacity to infer
demographic data from chest X-rays, leading to a key concern: do models using
demographic shortcuts have unfair predictions across subpopulations? In this
study, we conduct a thorough investigation into the extent to which medical AI
utilizes demographic encodings, focusing on potential fairness discrepancies
within both in-distribution training sets and external test sets. Our analysis
covers three key medical imaging disciplines: radiology, dermatology, and
ophthalmology, and incorporates data from six global chest X-ray datasets. We
confirm that medical imaging AI leverages demographic shortcuts in disease
classification. While correcting shortcuts algorithmically effectively
addresses fairness gaps to create ""locally optimal"" models within the original
data distribution, this optimality is not true in new test settings.
Surprisingly, we find that models with less encoding of demographic attributes
are often most ""globally optimal"", exhibiting better fairness during model
evaluation in new test environments. Our work establishes best practices for
medical imaging models which maintain their performance and fairness in
deployments beyond their initial training contexts, underscoring critical

with visual representations of medical conditions, we introduce the Multimodal
Medical Question Summarization (MMQS) Dataset. This dataset, a major
contribution to our work, pairs medical queries with visual aids, facilitating
a richer and more nuanced understanding of patient needs. We also propose a
framework, utilizing the power of Contrastive Language Image Pretraining(CLIP)

of CLIP, a multimodal foundation model, and various general-purpose LLMs,
comprising four main modules: the medical disorder identification module, the
relevant context generation module, the context filtration module for
distilling relevant medical concepts and knowledge, and finally, a
general-purpose LLM to generate visually aware medical question summaries.
Leveraging our MMQS dataset, we showcase how visual cues from images enhance

To categorize skin lesions, we employ four cutting-edge pre-trained models:
XceptionNet, EfficientNetV2S, InceptionResNetV2, and EfficientNetV2M. Image
augmentation approaches are used to reduce class imbalance and improve the

consultations. In medical dialogues, a proper diagnosis is crucial as it
establishes the foundation for future consultations. Clinicians typically
employ both intuitive and analytic reasoning to formulate a differential
diagnosis. This reasoning process hypothesizes and verifies a variety of
possible diseases and strives to generate a comprehensive and rigorous
diagnosis. However, recent studies on medical dialogue generation have
overlooked the significance of modeling a differential diagnosis, which hinders
the practical application of these systems. To address the above issue, we
propose a medical dialogue generation framework with the
Intuitive-then-Analytic Differential Diagnosis (IADDx). Our method starts with
a differential diagnosis via retrieval-based intuitive association and
subsequently refines it through a graph-enhanced analytic procedure. The
resulting differential diagnosis is then used to retrieve medical knowledge and
guide response generation. Experimental results on two datasets validate the
efficacy of our method. Besides, we demonstrate how our framework assists both
clinicians and patients in understanding the diagnostic process, for instance,
by producing intermediate results and graph-based diagnosis paths.",2024-01-12,2024,2024-01,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06541v1
"Developing ChatGPT for Biology and Medicine: A Complete Review of
  Biomedical Question Answering","ChatGPT explores a strategic blueprint of question answering (QA) in

domain data via natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal paradigms. By
transitioning the distribution of text, images, videos, and other modalities
from the general domain to the medical domain, these techniques have expedited
the progress of medical domain question answering (MDQA). They bridge the gap
between human natural language and sophisticated medical domain knowledge or
expert manual annotations, handling large-scale, diverse, unbalanced, or even
unlabeled data analysis scenarios in medical contexts. Central to our focus is
the utilizing of language models and multimodal paradigms for medical question
answering, aiming to guide the research community in selecting appropriate
mechanisms for their specific medical research requirements. Specialized tasks
such as unimodal-related question answering, reading comprehension, reasoning,
diagnosis, relation extraction, probability modeling, and others, as well as

"MICA: Towards Explainable Skin Lesion Diagnosis via Multi-Level
  Image-Concept Alignment","Black-box deep learning approaches have showcased significant potential in
the realm of medical image analysis. However, the stringent trustworthiness
requirements intrinsic to the medical field have catalyzed research into the
utilization of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), with a particular
focus on concept-based methods. Existing concept-based methods predominantly
apply concept annotations from a single perspective (e.g., global level),
neglecting the nuanced semantic relationships between sub-regions and concepts
embedded within medical images. This leads to underutilization of the valuable
medical information and may cause models to fall short in harmoniously
balancing interpretability and performance when employing inherently
interpretable architectures such as Concept Bottlenecks. To mitigate these
shortcomings, we propose a multi-modal explainable disease diagnosis framework
that meticulously aligns medical images and clinical-related concepts
semantically at multiple strata, encompassing the image level, token level, and
concept level. Moreover, our method allows for model intervention and offers
both textual and visual explanations in terms of human-interpretable concepts.

quantifies uncertainty in a way that is more closely aligned with the
reliability of LLMs during uncertainty quantification (UQ). We compare WSE with
six baseline methods on five free-form medical QA datasets, utilizing seven
popular large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that WSE
exhibits superior performance in UQ under two standard criteria for correctness
evaluation. Additionally, in terms of real-world medical QA applications, the
performance of LLMs is significantly enhanced (e.g., a 6.36% improvement in
model accuracy on the COVID-QA dataset) by employing responses with lower

address these limitations, we propose the Causal Inference-driven
Dual-Granularity Medication Recommendation method (CIDGMed). Our approach
leverages causal inference to uncover the relationships between

interpretability of recommendations. By integrating coarse-grained medication
effects with fine-grained molecular structure information, CIDGMed provides a
comprehensive representation of medications. Additionally, we employ a bias

"Deep learning with noisy labels in medical prediction problems: a
  scoping review","Objectives: Medical research faces substantial challenges from noisy labels
attributed to factors like inter-expert variability and machine-extracted
labels. Despite this, the adoption of label noise management remains limited,
and label noise is largely ignored. To this end, there is a critical need to
conduct a scoping review focusing on the problem space. This scoping review
aims to comprehensively review label noise management in deep learning-based
medical prediction problems, which includes label noise detection, label noise
handling, and evaluation. Research involving label uncertainty is also
included.
  Methods: Our scoping review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched 4
databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar.
Our search terms include ""noisy label AND medical / healthcare / clinical"",
""un-certainty AND medical / healthcare / clinical"", and ""noise AND medical /
healthcare / clinical"".
  Results: A total of 60 papers met inclusion criteria between 2016 and 2023. A
series of practical questions in medical research are investigated. These
include the sources of label noise, the impact of label noise, the detection of
label noise, label noise handling techniques, and their evaluation.
Categorization of both label noise detection methods and handling techniques
are provided.
  Discussion: From a methodological perspective, we observe that the medical
community has been up to date with the broader deep-learning community, given
that most techniques have been evaluated on medical data. We recommend
considering label noise as a standard element in medical research, even if it
is not dedicated to handling noisy labels. Initial experiments can start with
easy-to-implement methods, such as noise-robust loss functions, weighting, and
curriculum learning.",2024-03-19,2024,2024-03,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13111v1

"Dermacen Analytica: A Novel Methodology Integrating Multi-Modal Large
  Language Models with Machine Learning in tele-dermatology","The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates great promise in the field of
medical discovery, diagnostics and patient management. However, the vast
complexity of all medical domains require a more complex approach that combines
machine learning algorithms, classifiers, segmentation algorithms and, lately,
large language models. In this paper, we describe, implement and assess an
Artificial Intelligence-empowered system and methodology aimed at assisting the
diagnosis process of skin lesions and other skin conditions within the field of
dermatology that aims to holistically address the diagnostic process in this
domain. The workflow integrates large language, transformer-based vision models
and sophisticated machine learning tools. This holistic approach achieves a
nuanced interpretation of dermatological conditions that simulates and
facilitates a dermatologist's workflow. We assess our proposed methodology
through a thorough cross-model validation technique embedded in an evaluation
pipeline that utilizes publicly available medical case studies of skin
conditions and relevant images. To quantitatively score the system performance,
advanced machine learning and natural language processing tools are employed
which focus on similarity comparison and natural language inference.
Additionally, we incorporate a human expert evaluation process based on a
structured checklist to further validate our results. We implemented the
proposed methodology in a system which achieved approximate (weighted) scores
of 0.87 for both contextual understanding and diagnostic accuracy,
demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in enhancing dermatological

"Practical Applications of Advanced Cloud Services and Generative AI
  Systems in Medical Image Analysis","The medical field is one of the important fields in the application of
artificial intelligence technology. With the explosive growth and
diversification of medical data, as well as the continuous improvement of
medical needs and challenges, artificial intelligence technology is playing an
increasingly important role in the medical field. Artificial intelligence
technologies represented by computer vision, natural language processing, and
machine learning have been widely penetrated into diverse scenarios such as

generate syntheticACM-2 data, enhance images, aid in anomaly detection, and
facilitate image-to-image translation. Despite challenges like model
complexity, the applications of generative models in healthcare, including
Med-PaLM 2 technology, show promising results. By addressing limitations in
dataset size and diversity, these models contribute to more accurate diagnoses

"Non-negative Subspace Feature Representation for Few-shot Learning in
  Medical Imaging","Unlike typical visual scene recognition domains, in which massive datasets
are accessible to deep neural networks, medical image interpretations are often
obstructed by the paucity of data. In this paper, we investigate the
effectiveness of data-based few-shot learning in medical imaging by exploring
different data attribute representations in a low-dimensional space. We
introduce different types of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in
few-shot learning, addressing the data scarcity issue in medical image
classification. Extensive empirical studies are conducted in terms of
validating the effectiveness of NMF, especially its supervised variants (e.g.,
discriminative NMF, and supervised and constrained NMF with sparseness), and
the comparison with principal component analysis (PCA), i.e., the collaborative
representation-based dimensionality reduction technique derived from
eigenvectors. With 14 different datasets covering 11 distinct illness
categories, thorough experimental results and comparison with related
techniques demonstrate that NMF is a competitive alternative to PCA for
few-shot learning in medical imaging, and the supervised NMF algorithms are
more discriminative in the subspace with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, we
show that the part-based representation of NMF, especially its supervised
variants, is dramatically impactful in detecting lesion areas in medical
imaging with limited samples.",2024-04-03,2024,2024-04,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02656v2
"Investigation of Energy-efficient AI Model Architectures and Compression
  Techniques for ""Green"" Fetal Brain Segmentation","Artificial intelligence have contributed to advancements across various
industries. However, the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technologies
also raises concerns about their environmental impact, due to associated carbon
footprints to train computational models. Fetal brain segmentation in medical
imaging is challenging due to the small size of the fetal brain and the limited
image quality of fast 2D sequences. Deep neural networks are a promising method
to overcome this challenge. In this context, the construction of larger models
requires extensive data and computing power, leading to high energy
consumption. Our study aims to explore model architectures and compression
techniques that promote energy efficiency by optimizing the trade-off between
accuracy and energy consumption through various strategies such as lightweight
network design, architecture search, and optimized distributed training tools.
We have identified several effective strategies including optimization of data
loading, modern optimizers, distributed training strategy implementation, and
reduced floating point operations precision usage with light model

possibilities for artificial intelligence (AI) based medical diagnosis.
However, the application perspective of LLMs in real diagnostic scenarios is
still unclear because they are not adept at collecting patient data
proactively. This study presents a LLM-based diagnostic system that enhances
planning capabilities by emulating doctors. Our system involves two external
planners to handle planning tasks. The first planner employs a reinforcement
learning approach to formulate disease screening questions and conduct initial
diagnoses. The second planner uses LLMs to parse medical guidelines and conduct
differential diagnoses. By utilizing real patient electronic medical record
data, we constructed simulated dialogues between virtual patients and doctors
and evaluated the diagnostic abilities of our system. We demonstrated that our
system obtained impressive performance in both disease screening and

"Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Agents for Clinical Decision Making
  in Oncology","Multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems have the potential to enhance
clinical decision-making by interpreting various types of medical data.
However, the effectiveness of these models across all medical fields is
uncertain. Each discipline presents unique challenges that need to be addressed
for optimal performance. This complexity is further increased when attempting
to integrate different fields into a single model. Here, we introduce an
alternative approach to multimodal medical AI that utilizes the generalist
capabilities of a large language model (LLM) as a central reasoning engine.
This engine autonomously coordinates and deploys a set of specialized medical
AI tools. These tools include text, radiology and histopathology image
interpretation, genomic data processing, web searches, and document retrieval
from medical guidelines. We validate our system across a series of clinical
oncology scenarios that closely resemble typical patient care workflows. We
show that the system has a high capability in employing appropriate tools
(97%), drawing correct conclusions (93.6%), and providing complete (94%), and
helpful (89.2%) recommendations for individual patient cases while consistently
referencing relevant literature (82.5%) upon instruction. This work provides
evidence that LLMs can effectively plan and execute domain-specific models to
retrieve or synthesize new information when used as autonomous agents. This
enables them to function as specialist, patient-tailored clinical assistants.
It also simplifies regulatory compliance by allowing each component tool to be
individually validated and approved. We believe, that our work can serve as a
proof-of-concept for more advanced LLM-agents in the medical domain.",2024-04-06,2024,2024-04,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04667v1
"MedExpQA: Multilingual Benchmarking of Large Language Models for Medical
  Question Answering","Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential of facilitating the
development of Artificial Intelligence technology to assist medical experts for
interactive decision support, which has been demonstrated by their competitive
performances in Medical QA. However, while impressive, the required quality bar
for medical applications remains far from being achieved. Currently, LLMs
remain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate
hallucinated content. Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledge
lack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible to
evaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions. Finally, the situation is
particularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other than
English which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic. In order
to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the first
multilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in Medical
Question Answering. To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for the
first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be
leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs
performance. Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the gold
reference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches show
that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for
languages other than English. Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-art
RAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining and
integrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impact
results on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering. So far the

is currently a hot topic in Natural Language Understanding and Generation.
Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) have recently been adapted to
the medical domain, so that they can be used as a tool for mediating in
human-AI interaction. While these LLMs display competitive performance on
automated medical texts benchmarks, they have been pre-trained and evaluated
with a focus on a single language (English mostly). This is particularly true
of text-to-text models, which typically require large amounts of
domain-specific pre-training data, often not easily accessible for many
languages. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by compiling, to the
best of our knowledge, the largest multilingual corpus for the medical domain
in four languages, namely English, French, Italian and Spanish. This new corpus
has been used to train Medical mT5, the first open-source text-to-text

evaluation benchmarks for all four languages with the aim of facilitating
multilingual research in this domain. A comprehensive evaluation shows that
Medical mT5 outperforms both encoders and similarly sized text-to-text models

A Sentiment Analysis of Medical Text Based on Deep Learning,"The field of natural language processing (NLP) has made significant progress
with the rapid development of deep learning technologies. One of the research
directions in text sentiment analysis is sentiment analysis of medical texts,
which holds great potential for application in clinical diagnosis. However, the
medical field currently lacks sufficient text datasets, and the effectiveness
of sentiment analysis is greatly impacted by different model design approaches,
which presents challenges. Therefore, this paper focuses on the medical domain,
using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the
basic pre-trained model and experimenting with modules such as convolutional
neural network (CNN), fully connected network (FCN), and graph convolutional
networks (GCN) at the output layer. Experiments and analyses were conducted on
the METS-CoV dataset to explore the training performance after integrating
different deep learning networks. The results indicate that CNN models
outperform other networks when trained on smaller medical text datasets in
combination with pre-trained models like BERT. This study highlights the
significance of model selection in achieving effective sentiment analysis in
the medical domain and provides a reference for future research to develop more

"CausalMed: Causality-Based Personalized Medication Recommendation
  Centered on Patient health state","Medication recommendation systems are developed to recommend suitable
medications tailored to specific patient. Previous researches primarily focus
on learning medication representations, which have yielded notable advances.
However, these methods are limited to capturing personalized patient
representations due to the following primary limitations: (i) unable to capture
the differences in the impact of diseases/procedures on patients across various
patient health states; (ii) fail to model the direct causal relationships
between medications and specific health state of patients, resulting in an
inability to determine which specific disease each medication is treating. To
address these limitations, we propose CausalMed, a patient health state-centric
model capable of enhancing the personalization of patient representations.
Specifically, CausalMed first captures the causal relationship between
diseases/procedures and medications through causal discovery and evaluates
their causal effects. Building upon this, CausalMed focuses on analyzing the
health state of patients, capturing the dynamic differences of
diseases/procedures in different health states of patients, and transforming
diseases/procedures into medications on direct causal relationships.
Ultimately, CausalMed integrates information from longitudinal visits to
recommend medication combinations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
show that our method learns more personalized patient representation and
outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy and safety.",2024-04-18,2024,2024-04,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12228v3
A Large-scale Medical Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark,"Visual task adaptation has been demonstrated to be effective in adapting

visual modalities, such as color images, X-ray, and CT. To close this gap, we
present Med-VTAB, a large-scale Medical Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark
consisting of 1.68 million medical images for diverse organs, modalities, and
adaptation approaches. Based on Med-VTAB, we explore the scaling law of medical
prompt tuning concerning tunable parameters and the generalizability of medical
visual adaptation using non-medical/medical pre-train weights. Besides, we
study the impact of patient ID out-of-distribution on medical visual
adaptation, which is a real and challenging scenario. Furthermore, results from
Med-VTAB indicate that a single pre-trained model falls short in medical task
adaptation. Therefore, we introduce GMoE-Adapter, a novel method that combines
medical and general pre-training weights through a gated mixture-of-experts

this gap by automatically assigning a collaboration structure to a team of
LLMs. The assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the
medical task at hand, emulating real-world medical decision-making processes
adapted to tasks of varying complexities. We evaluate our framework and
baseline methods using state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of real-world

significant improvement of up to 4.2% (p < 0.05) compared to previous methods'
best performances. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents effectively determines
medical complexity to optimize for efficiency and accuracy across diverse

knowledge was grounded to the appropriate anatomical regions by using a
transformer-based grounded knowledge-enhanced module for fine-grained alignment
between textural features of medical knowledge and the corresponding anatomical

"MoVL:Exploring Fusion Strategies for the Domain-Adaptive Application of
  Pretrained Models in Medical Imaging Tasks","Medical images are often more difficult to acquire than natural images due to
the specialism of the equipment and technology, which leads to less medical
image datasets. So it is hard to train a strong pretrained medical vision
model. How to make the best of natural pretrained vision model and adapt in
medical domain still pends. For image classification, a popular method is
linear probe (LP). However, LP only considers the output after feature
extraction. Yet, there exists a gap between input medical images and natural
pretrained vision model. We introduce visual prompting (VP) to fill in the gap,
and analyze the strategies of coupling between LP and VP. We design a joint
learning loss function containing categorisation loss and discrepancy loss,
which describe the variance of prompted and plain images, naming this joint
training strategy MoVL (Mixture of Visual Prompting and Linear Probe). We
experiment on 4 medical image classification datasets, with two mainstream
architectures, ResNet and CLIP. Results shows that without changing the
parameters and architecture of backbone model and with less parameters, there
is potential for MoVL to achieve full finetune (FF) accuracy (on four medical
datasets, average 90.91% for MoVL and 91.13% for FF). On out of distribution

MMedAgent: Learning to Use Medical Tools with Multi-modal Agent,"Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite being successful, exhibit
limited generality and often fall short when compared to specialized models.
Recently, LLM-based agents have been developed to address these challenges by
selecting appropriate specialized models as tools based on user inputs.
However, such advancements have not been extensively explored within the
medical domain. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the first agent
explicitly designed for the medical field, named \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{Med}ical \textbf{Agent} (MMedAgent). We curate an instruction-tuning
dataset comprising six medical tools solving seven tasks across five
modalities, enabling the agent to choose the most suitable tools for a given
task. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMedAgent achieves superior
performance across a variety of medical tasks compared to state-of-the-art

"MedVH: Towards Systematic Evaluation of Hallucination for Large Vision
  Language Models in the Medical Context","Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved superior
performance in various tasks on natural image and text data, which inspires a
large amount of studies for LVLMs fine-tuning and training. Despite their
advancements, there has been scant research on the robustness of these models
against hallucination when fine-tuned on smaller datasets. In this study, we
introduce a new benchmark dataset, the Medical Visual Hallucination Test
(MedVH), to evaluate the hallucination of domain-specific LVLMs. MedVH
comprises five tasks to evaluate hallucinations in LVLMs within the medical
context, which includes tasks for comprehensive understanding of textual and
visual input, as well as long textual response generation. Our extensive
experiments with both general and medical LVLMs reveal that, although medical
LVLMs demonstrate promising performance on standard medical tasks, they are
particularly susceptible to hallucinations, often more so than the general
models, raising significant concerns about the reliability of these
domain-specific models. For medical LVLMs to be truly valuable in real-world
applications, they must not only accurately integrate medical knowledge but
also maintain robust reasoning abilities to prevent hallucination. Our work

"Explainable artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection and risk
  prediction: A systematic scoping review","With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), data-driven algorithms are
becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain. However, due to the
nonlinear and complex behavior of many of these algorithms, decision-making by
such algorithms is not trustworthy for clinicians and is considered a black-box
process. Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review
investigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk
prediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore,
PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search
strategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on
peer-reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets.
Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis.
The results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top
model-agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage,
explaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of
biomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model
primarily explained tree-based ensemble machine learning models. The most
common reason is that SHAP is model agnostic, which makes it both popular and
useful for explaining any model prediction. Additionally, it is relatively easy
to implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as

Segment Anything Model (SAM), which excels in intelligent image segmentation,

Quantization is an effective solution for model compression; however,
traditional methods rely heavily on original data for calibration, which raises
widespread concerns about medical data privacy and security. In this paper, we

pre-trained models, which facilitates high-quality data synthesis as a
substitute for real data. Furthermore, we introduce scale reparameterization to
ensure the accuracy of low-bit quantization. We perform extensive segmentation
experiments on various datasets, and DFQ-SAM consistently provides significant
performance on low-bit quantization. DFQ-SAM eliminates the need for data

PretexEval that dynamically generates reliable and diverse test samples to
evaluate LLMs for any given medical knowledge base. We notice that test samples
produced directly from knowledge bases by templates or LLMs may introduce
factual errors and also lack diversity. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel schema into our proposed evaluation framework that employs predicate
equivalence transformations to produce a series of variants for any given
medical knowledge point. Finally, these produced predicate variants are
converted into textual language, resulting in a series of reliable and diverse

"CBIDR: A novel method for information retrieval combining image and data
  by means of TOPSIS applied to medical diagnosis","Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) have shown promising results in the
field of medical diagnosis, which aims to provide support to medical
professionals (doctor or pathologist). However, the ultimate decision regarding
the diagnosis is made by the medical professional, drawing upon their
accumulated experience. In this context, we believe that artificial
intelligence can play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges in medical
diagnosis not by making the final decision but by assisting in the diagnosis
process with the most relevant information. The CBIR methods use similarity
metrics to compare feature vectors generated from images using Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). In addition to the information contained in medical
images, clinical data about the patient is often available and is also relevant
in the final decision-making process by medical professionals. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named CBIDR, which leverage both medical images and
clinical data of patient, combining them through the ranking algorithm TOPSIS.
The goal is to aid medical professionals in their final diagnosis by retrieving
images and clinical data of patient that are most similar to query data from
the database. As a case study, we illustrate our CBIDR for diagnostic of oral
cancer including histopathological images and clinical data of patient.
Experimental results in terms of accuracy achieved 97.44% in Top-1 and 100% in
Top-5 showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",2024-09-26,2024,2024-09,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06180v1

"Building a Chinese Medical Dialogue System: Integrating Large-scale
  Corpora and Novel Models","The global COVID-19 pandemic underscored major deficiencies in traditional
healthcare systems, hastening the advancement of online medical services,
especially in medical triage and consultation. However, existing studies face
two main challenges. First, the scarcity of large-scale, publicly available,
domain-specific medical datasets due to privacy concerns, with current datasets
being small and limited to a few diseases, limiting the effectiveness of triage
methods based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Second, existing methods
lack medical knowledge and struggle to accurately understand professional terms

we construct the Large-scale Chinese Medical Dialogue Corpora (LCMDC), thereby
addressing the data shortage in this field. Moreover, we further propose a
novel triage system that combines BERT-based supervised learning with prompt

IMAS: A Comprehensive Agentic Approach to Rural Healthcare Delivery,"Since the onset of COVID-19, rural communities worldwide have faced
significant challenges in accessing healthcare due to the migration of
experienced medical professionals to urban centers. Semi-trained caregivers,

translation, medical complexity assessment, expert network integration, final
medical advice generation, and response simplification. Our innovative
framework ensures context-sensitive, adaptive, and reliable medical assistance,
capable of clinical triaging, diagnostics, and identifying cases requiring
specialist intervention. The system is designed to handle cultural nuances and
varying literacy levels, providing clear and actionable medical advice in local

Representation Learning of Structured Data for Medical Foundation Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, including healthcare. However, their ability to effectively
represent structured non-textual data, such as the alphanumeric medical codes
used in records like ICD-10 or SNOMED-CT, is limited and has been particularly
exposed in recent research. This paper examines the challenges LLMs face in
processing medical codes due to the shortcomings of current tokenization
methods. As a result, we introduce the UniStruct architecture to design a
multimodal medical foundation model of unstructured text and structured data,
which addresses these challenges by adapting subword tokenization techniques
specifically for the structured medical codes. Our approach is validated
through model pre-training on both an extensive internal medical database and a
public repository of structured medical records. Trained on over 1 billion

23% improvement in evaluation metrics, with around 2% gain attributed to our
proposed tokenization. Additionally, when evaluated on the EHRSHOT public
benchmark with a 1/1000 fraction of the pre-training data, the UniStruct model
improves performance on over 42% of the downstream tasks. Our approach not only
enhances the representation and generalization capabilities of patient-centric

interpreting medical images and accurately analyzing patients' facial emotions
and facial paralysis conditions. The model achieved an accuracy of 72.59% on
the FER2013 facial emotion recognition dataset, with a 91.1% accuracy in

"Concept Complement Bottleneck Model for Interpretable Medical Image
  Diagnosis","Models based on human-understandable concepts have received extensive
attention to improve model interpretability for trustworthy artificial
intelligence in the field of medical image analysis. These methods can provide
convincing explanations for model decisions but heavily rely on the detailed
annotation of pre-defined concepts. Consequently, they may not be effective in
cases where concepts or annotations are incomplete or low-quality. Although
some methods automatically discover effective and new visual concepts rather
than using pre-defined concepts or could find some human-understandable
concepts via large Language models, they are prone to veering away from medical
diagnostic evidence and are challenging to understand. In this paper, we
propose a concept complement bottleneck model for interpretable medical image
diagnosis with the aim of complementing the existing concept set and finding
new concepts bridging the gap between explainable models. Specifically, we
propose to use concept adapters for specific concepts to mine the concept
differences and score concepts in their own attention channels to support
almost fairly concept learning. Then, we devise a concept complement strategy
to learn new concepts while jointly using known concepts to improve model

leads to the highlighting of extraneous tokens irrelevant to the ICD code. To
facilitate accurate interpretability in medical language models, this paper
leverages dictionary learning that can efficiently extract sparsely activated
representations from dense language model embeddings in superposition. Compared
with common label attention mechanisms, our model goes beyond token-level
representations by building an interpretable dictionary which enhances the
mechanistic-based explanations for each ICD code prediction, even when the
highlighted tokens are medically irrelevant. We show that dictionary features
can steer model behavior, elucidate the hidden meanings of upwards of 90% of
medically irrelevant tokens, and are human interpretable.",2024-10-31,2024,2024-10,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00173v2
"Optical Flow Representation Alignment Mamba Diffusion Model for Medical
  Video Generation","Medical video generation models are expected to have a profound impact on the
healthcare industry, including but not limited to medical education and
training, surgical planning, and simulation. Current video diffusion models
typically build on image diffusion architecture by incorporating temporal
operations (such as 3D convolution and temporal attention). Although this
approach is effective, its oversimplification limits spatio-temporal
performance and consumes substantial computational resources. To counter this,
we propose Medical Simulation Video Generator (MedSora), which incorporates
three key elements: i) a video diffusion framework integrates the advantages of
attention and Mamba, balancing low computational load with high-quality video
generation, ii) an optical flow representation alignment method that implicitly
enhances attention to inter-frame pixels, and iii) a video variational
autoencoder (VAE) with frequency compensation addresses the information loss of
medical features that occurs when transforming pixel space into latent features
and then back to pixel frames. Extensive experiments and applications
demonstrate that MedSora exhibits superior visual quality in generating medical
videos, outperforming the most advanced baseline methods. Further results and

"Simulation of Nanorobots with Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement
  Learning for Advanced Cancer Cell Detection and Tracking","Nanorobots are a promising development in targeted drug delivery and the
treatment of neurological disorders, with potential for crossing the
blood-brain barrier (BBB). These small devices leverage advancements in
nanotechnology and bioengineering for precise navigation and targeted payload
delivery, particularly for conditions like brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease,
and Parkinson's disease. Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML) has improved the navigation and effectiveness of
nanorobots, allowing them to detect and interact with cancer cells through
biomarker analysis. This study presents a new reinforcement learning (RL)
framework for optimizing nanorobot navigation in complex biological
environments, focusing on cancer cell detection by analyzing the concentration
gradients of surrounding biomarkers. We utilize a computer simulation model to
explore the behavior of nanorobots in a three-dimensional space with cancer
cells and biological barriers. The proposed method uses Q-learning to refine
movement strategies based on real-time biomarker concentration data, enabling
nanorobots to autonomously navigate to cancerous tissues for targeted drug
delivery. This research lays the groundwork for future laboratory experiments
and clinical applications, with implications for personalized medicine and less
invasive cancer treatments. The integration of intelligent nanorobots could
revolutionize therapeutic strategies, reducing side effects and enhancing
treatment effectiveness for cancer patients. Further research will investigate
the practical deployment of these technologies in medical settings, aiming to
unlock the full potential of nanorobotics in healthcare.",2024-11-04,2024,2024-11,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02345v1

"The Limited Impact of Medical Adaptation of Large Language and
  Vision-Language Models","Several recent works seek to adapt general-purpose large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for medical applications through
continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works
typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining improves performance on
various downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical exam questions. In
this paper, we compare ten ""medical"" LLMs and two VLMs against their
corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs
and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models
in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical
question answering (QA). For instance, on clinical-note-based QA tasks in the
3-shot setting, medical LLMs outperform their base models in only 26.7% of
cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 16.7% of cases, and perform significantly
worse in the remaining 56.7% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i)
comparing each medical model directly against its base model; (ii) optimizing
the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii)
accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. Our findings suggest
that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen
the conclusions of future studies.",2024-11-13,2024,2024-11,medical,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08870v2
"Comprehensive and Practical Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  Systems for Medical Question Answering","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive
tasks such as those from medical domain. However, the sensitive nature of the
medical domain necessitates a completely accurate and trustworthy system. While
existing RAG benchmarks primarily focus on the standard retrieve-answer
setting, they overlook many practical scenarios that measure crucial aspects of
a reliable medical system. This paper addresses this gap by providing a
comprehensive evaluation framework for medical question-answering (QA) systems
in a RAG setting for these situations, including sufficiency, integration, and
robustness. We introduce Medical Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark
(MedRGB) that provides various supplementary elements to four medical QA
datasets for testing LLMs' ability to handle these specific scenarios.
Utilizing MedRGB, we conduct extensive evaluations of both state-of-the-art
commercial LLMs and open-source models across multiple retrieval conditions.
Our experimental results reveals current models' limited ability to handle
noise and misinformation in the retrieved documents. We further analyze the
LLMs' reasoning processes to provides valuable insights and future directions

A Benchmark for Long-Form Medical Question Answering,"There is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in
long-form medical question answering (QA). Most existing medical QA evaluation
benchmarks focus on automatic metrics and multiple-choice questions. While
valuable, these benchmarks fail to fully capture or assess the complexities of
real-world clinical applications where LLMs are being deployed. Furthermore,
existing studies on evaluating long-form answer generation in medical QA are
primarily closed-source, lacking access to human medical expert annotations,
which makes it difficult to reproduce results and enhance existing baselines.
In this work, we introduce a new publicly available benchmark featuring
real-world consumer medical questions with long-form answer evaluations
annotated by medical doctors. We performed pairwise comparisons of responses
from various open and closed-source medical and general-purpose LLMs based on
criteria such as correctness, helpfulness, harmfulness, and bias. Additionally,
we performed a comprehensive LLM-as-a-judge analysis to study the alignment
between human judgments and LLMs. Our preliminary results highlight the strong

Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Medical Applications: A Review,"The continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI) theory has
propelled this field to unprecedented heights, owing to the relentless efforts
of scholars and researchers. In the medical realm, AI takes a pivotal role,
leveraging robust machine learning (ML) algorithms. AI technology in medical
imaging aids physicians in X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) diagnoses, conducts pattern recognition and disease
prediction based on acoustic data, delivers prognoses on disease types and
developmental trends for patients, and employs intelligent health management
wearable devices with human-computer interaction technology to name but a few.
While these well-established applications have significantly assisted in
medical field diagnoses, clinical decision-making, and management,
collaboration between the medical and AI sectors faces an urgent challenge: How
to substantiate the reliability of decision-making? The underlying issue stems
from the conflict between the demand for accountability and result transparency
in medical scenarios and the black-box model traits of AI. This article reviews

"Towards Next-Generation Medical Agent: How o1 is Reshaping
  Decision-Making in Medical Scenarios","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become essential in modern healthcare, with
large language models (LLMs) offering promising advances in clinical
decision-making. Traditional model-based approaches, including those leveraging
in-context demonstrations and those with specialized medical fine-tuning, have
demonstrated strong performance in medical language processing but struggle
with real-time adaptability, multi-step reasoning, and handling complex medical
tasks. Agent-based AI systems address these limitations by incorporating
reasoning traces, tool selection based on context, knowledge retrieval, and
both short- and long-term memory. These additional features enable the medical
AI agent to handle complex medical scenarios where decision-making should be
built on real-time interaction with the environment. Therefore, unlike
conventional model-based approaches that treat medical queries as isolated
questions, medical AI agents approach them as complex tasks and behave more
like human doctors. In this paper, we study the choice of the backbone LLM for
medical AI agents, which is the foundation for the agent's overall reasoning
and action generation. In particular, we consider the emergent o1 model and
examine its impact on agents' reasoning, tool-use adaptability, and real-time
information retrieval across diverse clinical scenarios, including high-stakes
settings such as intensive care units (ICUs). Our findings demonstrate o1's
ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy and consistency, paving the way for

addressing this problem, its safe deployment in patient-facing roles remains
largely unexplored in real-world medical settings. We present the first
large-scale evaluation of a physician-supervised LLM-based conversational agent

  Our agent, Mo, was integrated into an existing medical advice chat service.
Over a three-week period, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment with
926 cases to evaluate patient experience and satisfaction. Among these, Mo
handled 298 complete patient interactions, for which we report
physician-assessed measures of safety and medical accuracy.
  Patients reported higher clarity of information (3.73 vs 3.62 out of 4, p <
0.05) and overall satisfaction (4.58 vs 4.42 out of 5, p < 0.05) with
AI-assisted conversations compared to standard care, while showing equivalent
levels of trust and perceived empathy. The high opt-in rate (81% among
respondents) exceeded previous benchmarks for AI acceptance in healthcare.
Physician oversight ensured safety, with 95% of conversations rated as ""good""
or ""excellent"" by general practitioners experienced in operating a medical

segmentation is essential for automated diagnosis and treatment. Although
recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved segmentation
accuracy, current models often face challenges in adaptability and

These limitations stem from the substantial variations between imaging
modalities and the inherent complexity of medical data. To address these
challenges, we propose the Strategy-driven Interactive Segmentation Model
(SISeg), built on SAM2, which enhances segmentation performance across various
medical imaging modalities by integrating a selection engine. To mitigate
memory bottlenecks and optimize prompt frame selection during the inference of
2D image sequences, we developed an automated system, the Adaptive Frame
Selection Engine (AFSE). This system dynamically selects the optimal prompt
frames without requiring extensive prior medical knowledge and enhances the
interpretability of the model's inference process through an interactive

answering primarily focused on textual and visual (image) modalities, which may
be inefficient in answering questions requiring demonstration. In recent years,
significant progress has been achieved due to the introduction of large-scale
language-vision datasets and the development of efficient deep neural
techniques that bridge the gap between language and visual understanding.
Improvements have been made in numerous vision-and-language tasks, such as
visual captioning visual question answering, and natural language video
localization. Most of the existing work on language vision focused on creating
datasets and developing solutions for open-domain applications. We believe
medical videos may provide the best possible answers to many first aid, medical
emergency, and medical education questions. With increasing interest in AI to
support clinical decision-making and improve patient engagement, there is a
need to explore such challenges and develop efficient algorithms for medical
